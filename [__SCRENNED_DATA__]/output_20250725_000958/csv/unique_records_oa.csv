There is, however, little research on how they compare to adolescents referred due to mental health problems (MHR). We set out to compare psychopathology in adolescents referred to our specialized gender identity unit (n = 84) and adolescents referred to a general adolescent psychiatric clinic (n = 293) in a university hospital setting in Finland. Of the GR adolescents, 40.9% had not received any psychiatric diagnosis during adolescence. Eating disorders were less common in the GR than in the MHR group, but otherwise the prevalences of disorders did not differ statistically significantly. At the symptom level, the GR adolescents displayed significantly more suicidal ideation and talk and less alcohol abuse and eating disorder symptoms than did the MHR adolescents, but otherwise their symptom profiles were comparable. Additionally, the GR adolescents had significantly fewer total externalizing symptoms than did the MHR adolescents. Adolescents seeking gender affirming treatments present with psychiatric symptoms and disorders comparable to those seen among adolescent psychiatric patients. Medical gender affirming care may not be a sufficient intervention for treating psychiatric comorbidities of adolescents with gender dysphoria. © 2022"

Nutritional problems in cis and trans women. . https://doi.org/10.20960/nh.04952","Introduction: Women deserve special attention due to the different requirements they have in comparison with men. In the same way, transgender women need individualized attention. Transgender women are at greater risk of suffering heart attacks or ischemic accidents, among other diseases, and are also at greater risk of developing eating disorders, poorer weight control and poorer perception of their image. Hormone therapy for gender reaffirmation in trans women modifies their body composition, and may also increase the risk of suffering from some pathologies. The nutritional needs of cisgender women are different from those of men, and trans women also have special needs, which may depend on whether or not they follow hormone therapy. Dietary studies, although scarce, suggest that transgender women have poor dietary habits and lifestyle. It is necessary to deepen the study of the nutritional situation of the female group, considering its diversity, and to develop standards and references appropriate to each case that allow better attention to the needs of these groups.; Introducción: El colectivo femenino merece una especial atención debido a los diferentes requerimientos que tienen en comparación con el colectivo masculino. De la misma manera, se necesita atender de manera individualizada al colectivo transgénero. En concreto, las mujeres trans tienen más riesgo de sufrir infartos o accidentes isquémicos, entre otras enfermedades, y también tienen mayor riesgo de desarrollar trastornos del comportamiento alimentario y peor control de peso y percepción de su imagen. La terapia hormonal de reafirmación de género en mujeres trans modifica su composición corporal y también puede aumentar el riesgo de padecer algunas patologías. Las necesidades nutricionales de las mujeres cisgénero son diferentes a las de los varones, y también tienen necesidades especiales las mujeres trans, que pueden depender del seguimiento o no de un tratamiento hormonal. Los estudios dietéticos, aunque escasos, sugieren que las mujeres transgénero tienen unos hábitos dietéticos y un estilo de vida menos saludables. Es necesario profundizar en el estudio de la situación nutricional del colectivo femenino, atendiendo a la diversidad del mismo, y desarrollar estándares y referencias adecuadas a cada caso que permitan una mejor atención de las necesidades de estos colectivos."

Most research regarding healthcare experiences of trans people with EDs focuses on specialized treatment. This qualitative study explored the experiences of trans patients with ED symptoms in trans-affirming primary care, which offers clinical support for gender affirmation in the context of interpersonally gender-affirming primary care services. Twenty-two participants were recruited via social media to participate in focus groups (n = 5). Researchers utilized thematic analysis. Participants reported gender-affirming and non-affirming experiences, experienced unwelcome comments from providers regarding bodies and gender, encountered barriers to disclosing their ED symptoms, felt transition-related medical care supported recovery but did not always resolve their ED symptoms, felt they had to self-advocate, and wanted their providers to recognize them as whole people (beyond their ED and transness) who experience joy. Importantly, despite being trans-affirming, participants critiqued trans-affirming primary care as perpetuating weight stigma and binary gender norms. Participants recommended providers receive ED training, implement universal ED screening, and explore how sociocultural norms regarding weight and gender negatively impact trans health outcomes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Method: Data consisting of n = 414,299 college students' responses to the American College Health Association's National College Health Assessment between fall 2015 and spring 2019 were utilized for this study. Overall and stratified adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were used to assess the association between different facets of identity (i.e., race/ethnicity, gender identity, and sexual orientation) and probable EDs. Results: Among all, in our analytic sample, 7.15% reported a probable ED. Interactions between all three identity variables were significant, and thus stratified odds ratios were evaluated. Transgender men were significantly more likely to report probable ED than cisgender male peers within the following racial/ethnic groups: non-Hispanic White (aOR: 3.33; 95% CI: 2.79, 3.96; p <.0001), non-Hispanic Black (aOR: 3.29; 95% CI: 1.72, 6.28; p =.0003), Hispanic (aOR: 2.31; 95% CI: 1.55, 3.43; p <.0001), Asian or Pacific Islander (aOR: 2.19; 95% CI: 1.45, 3.30; p =.0002), Biracial or Multicultural (aOR: 3.36; 95% CI: 2.17, 5.22; p <.0001), and other (aOR: 4.19; 95% CI: 2.25, 7.79; p <.0001). Conclusions: This study underscores the importance of increasing our understanding of interactions between marginalized identities and the ways in which minority identity informs ED risk. Public significance: The impact of multiple marginalized identities on ED outcomes is not well understood. Our study expands on previous ACHA-NCHA studies by addressing identity intersectionality, looking at more than one identity at a time (i.e., specifically race/ethnicity, gender identity, and sexual orientation). Our results contribute unique risk profiles for students who identify with multiple marginalized groups. Further, they indicate that that these associations vary based on the compounded effect of the demographic factors considered. © 2023 The Authors.

However, the role that romantic relationships can play in eating disorder (ED) recovery has not been comprehensively investigated. The present study aimed to explore the ways that people living with and recovering from EDs experience their romantic relationships, with the specific objective of developing a novel theoretical framework, grounded in the experiences of people in diverse romantic relationships, to guide future research on the topic. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with 66 people (45 cisgender women, 11 cisgender men, 9 nonbinary people, and 1 transgender man) living with and recovering from EDs while in romantic relationships. Our grounded theory analysis yielded a theoretical model of ED management in romantic relationships, revealing that Individual and Relationship Characteristics intersected with Relationship-Related Stressors and were navigated using Eating Disorder and Relationship Management Strategies. Combined with Partner Support and Tensions, these management strategies were related to Relationship and Mental Health Outcomes, which affected and were affected by Future Concerns. Future researchers should continue to build on, expand, and modify this model and further explore the role of romantic relationships in the experience of people living with EDs. © 2024 The Authors"

Examining day hospital treatment outcomes for sexual minority patients with eating disorders. . https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23362","Objective: Epidemiological data support that sexual minorities (SM) report higher levels of eating pathology. Theories suggest these disparities exist due to stressors specific to belonging to a minority group; however, few studies have specifically explored differences between SM and heterosexual individuals in clinical eating disorder samples. Thus, the present study compared SM and heterosexual patients with eating disorders on demographic characteristics and eating disorder and psychological outcomes during day hospital treatment. Method: Patients (N = 389) completed surveys of eating pathology, mood, anxiety, and skills use at treatment admission, 1-month post-admission, discharge, and 6-month follow-up. Overall, 19.8% of patients (n = 79) identified as SM, while 8.0% (n = 32) reported not identifying with any sexual orientation. SM were more likely to present across genders (17.7% of females, 24.2% of males, 33.3% of transgender patients, and 87.5% of nonbinary patients). Results: SM patients were significantly more likely to endorse major depressive disorder, panic disorder, and self-harm at admission than their heterosexual counterparts. Multilevel models demonstrated that across time, SM patients demonstrated greater eating pathology, emotion dysregulation, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. Significant interactions between sexual orientation and time were found for eating pathology and emotion dysregulation, such that although SM patients started treatment with higher scores, they improved at a faster rate compared to heterosexual patients. Discussion: Consistent with minority stress theory, SM patients report greater overall eating disorder and comorbid symptoms. Importantly, results do not support that there appear to be significant disparities in treatment outcome for SM patients in this sample of day hospital patients. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC"

The sample included 3299 adults who screened positive for ARFID using two validated scales. SI over the past two weeks was assessed using item 9 from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The overall prevalence of SI was 22.9 %, with a higher prevalence among transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) individuals (34.7 %) compared to cisgender men (17.8 %) and cisgender women (16.8 %). Participants with SI (mean = 27.6 years, SD = 10.1) were younger than those without SI (mean = 32.3 years, SD = 13.4). The ARFID dimensions picky eating/sensory-based avoidance and low appetite/lack of interest in eating or food were positively associated with SI; however, these associations became non-significant after adjusting for age, gender, and depression. Interestingly, fear/concern about aversive consequences was significantly negatively associated with SI after adjusting for covariates. Our results suggest that the fear presentation of ARFID may be a distinct subtype with a lower risk of suicidality compared to other presentations, highlighting the importance of comprehensively evaluating ARFID dimensions and underlying depressive symptoms to better address the risk of suicidality. © 2025"

Adolescents with PHW (vs. PLW) were more likely to be diagnosed with AAN (67.9 %, p <.001), identify as cisgender male (p <.001) and to have lost more weight prior to presentation (p <.001). Perceived caregiver burden was lower among adolescents with PHW vs. PLW (p <.001). Further research should expand on this preliminary study exploring associations between premorbid weight history on patient and caregiver factors at treatment presentation and conclusion to enhance the efficacy of evidence-based treatment across the weight-spectrum. © 2023 The Authors"

Methods: Using an online survey with participants from France (n = 952), social rejection was assessed using a feeling thermometer and a social distance scale, while social perceptions were measured using visual analog scales. Results: A stigma map for these different disorders is drawn up, revealing the social perceptions and levels of stigmatization specific to certain mental illnesses. Controlling for relevant social perceptions (i.e., danger, warmth, competence), we found that perception of burden was positively and significantly associated to social distance and negative feeling for 73% and 67% of mental illnesses, respectively. The perception of vital force was negatively and significantly related to social distance and negative feeling for 87% and 20% of mental illnesses, respectively. The change in R2 between model 1 (i.e. perception of danger, warmth, competence) and model 2 (i.e. model 1 + perceptions of vital force and burden) significantly improved in 100% of cases for social distance and 67% of cases for negative feeling. Conclusion: These preliminary data provide support for the SUBAR model and call for further investigations to better understand the social rejection of people with mental illnesses.

While ED rates have risen during the COVID pandemic, trends in co-occurring autism, ADHD, and GD have yet to be investigated in detail or at scale by way of large electronic medical record data. Objectives: To investigate trends in rates of co-occurring autism, ADHD, and GD among children, adolescents, and young adults with EDs in years prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We utilized a de-identified multinational electronic health records database (TriNetX) with 48,558 individuals aged 5-26 diagnosed with eating disorders (EDs) at least twice between 2017 and 2022. The primary predictor variable differentiated between the years of each person’s index (first) ED diagnosis (2017-2019 vs. 2020-2022). The primary outcome variable was the rate of new co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses of autism, ADHD, and GD in the year following each patient’s first ED diagnosis. We applied propensity score-matched multivariable logistic regressions to compare primary outcomes between 2017-2019 and 2020-2022. Results: Our analysis included 17,445 individuals diagnosed with EDs in 2017-2019 (8% autism, 13.5% ADHD, 1.9% GD) and 31,113 diagnosed with EDs in 2020-2022 (8% autism, 14.6% ADHD, 3.2% GD). After 1:1 propensity score matching, 17,202 individuals from the 2017-2019 cohort were matched to peers mirroring the 2020-2022 cohort. Those diagnosed in 2020-2022 showed a 19% (aOR[95%CI]=1.19[1.07-1.33]), 25% (aOR=1.25[1.04-1.49]), and 36% (aOR=1.36[1.07-1.74]) increase in odds for autism, ADHD, and GD diagnoses, respectively, within the 365 days after the index EDs diagnosis, compared to the 2017-2019 cohort. Discussion: Rates of autism, ADHD, and GD are significantly higher in individuals with ED in the post-pandemic 2020-2022 cohort in comparison to the pre-pandemic 2017-2019 cohort, even after controlling for baseline levels of co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses. Such findings reveal a critical gap in our current understanding of the totality of ways in which COVID-19 may have impacted the onset and clinical course of EDs, autism, ADHD, and GD among children, adolescents, and young adults.

We conducted a retrospective longitudinal study by analyzing ED visits for MHDs from 10 March 2019 to 10 March 2021. A total of 1407 ED visits for MHDs were registered: 702 in the pre-COVID-19 and 707 in the COVID-19 period. The cumulative incidence of ED visits for MHDs was 1.22% in the pre-COVID-19 period and 1.77% in the COVID-19 period, with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001). The principal characteristics of the adolescent with MHDs during the pandemic period: the odds of comorbidities decreased by 26% (p = 0.02), and the odds of transfer from other hospitals decreased by 71% (p < 0.001), while the odds of the ED presentation as first psychiatric episode were twice greater (p < 0.001). The risk of hospitalization increased by 54% (p = 0.001). Regarding psychopathology, the likelihood of attempted suicide increased by 74% during the pandemic (p = 0.02). The rate of mood and eating disorders grew significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic period (p = 0.005 and p = 0.031, respectively). Monitoring ED visits for MHDs and understanding changes in the profile of adolescents presenting to ED helps to reinforce the role of ED in identifying special clinical needs for these vulnerable patients in case of a future public health crisis. © 2023 by the authors."

The current study assessed stigma experiences from peers at school, self-esteem, LGBTQ pride, and overlapping social positions as they relate to disordered eating behaviors among LGBTQ adolescents. Method: Participants included 11,083 adolescents (Mage = 15.6, SD = 1.3; 34.8% transgender/gender diverse) from a large national survey study of LGBTQ adolescents from 2017. Exhaustive Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detection analysis was used to identify bias-based bullying experiences (i.e., weight-based, identity-based), self-esteem, LGBTQ pride, and overlapping social positions (i.e., gender identity, sexual identity, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI) percentile) associated with the highest prevalence of unhealthy weight control behaviors, extreme unhealthy weight control behaviors, and past year binge eating. Results: Adolescents in the 28 identified groups with a high prevalence of disordered eating behavior held at least one structurally marginalized social position (e.g., high BMI), bias-based bullying experience, low self-esteem, or low LGBTQ pride in addition to being LGBTQ. Weight-based bullying was a salient risk-factor for disordered eating across social positions. Among adolescents with the same social positions, levels of self-esteem, LGBTQ pride, but no bias-based bullying experience, prevalence estimates of disordered eating were, on average, 23% lower. Discussion: LGBTQ adolescents with multiple marginalized social positions and related factors engage in disproportionately high prevalence disordered eating. Findings underscore the importance of addressing intersecting experiences of stigma to reduce disordered eating and promote health equity among adolescents. Public significance: Multiply marginalized LGBTQ adolescents, most of whom also reported experiencing bias-based bullying from peers at school, reported disproportionately high prevalence disordered eating. In comparison groups of adolescents with no bias-based bullying experience, prevalence of disordered eating was, on average, 24% lower.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was part of a larger study in which an online survey was administered during autumn quarter 2020 to undergraduate students at a northwestern U.S. public university. Measures included EC (ecSI 2.0™), weight-and-body shame and/or guilt (WEB–SG), weight satisfaction, current weight loss effort, and eating disorder risk. Results: Of the 1996 respondents included in the final analyses, 40.2 % were eating competent (ecSI 2.0™ ≥32). Gender distribution was 71.6 % women, 23.1 % men, and 4.6 % trans-and-gender non-conforming (TGNC). WEB–SG and WEB-S were higher in women and TGNC than in men. Weight satisfaction was lower in women and TGNC students than men, and 47.3 % of the sample was trying to lose weight at the time of the study. Eating disorder (ED) risk was prevalent with nearly 34 % scoring ≥2 on SCOFF and 33 % reporting they saw themselves as having an ED now or in the past. Significant factors of EC varied for each gender, although WEB-S was a shared model factor for all genders. Conclusion: EC may be protective, as this was related to less WEB-S in all genders; less WEB-G and greater weight satisfaction in men and women; and lower likelihood of ED risk and trying to lose weight among women. Further research is needed to elucidate whether these maladaptive weight-and-body attitudes and behaviors in college students can be improved to increase EC.

However, prolactin monitoring is rarely conducted (0.1–10 %), and the prevalence and characteristics of abnormal prolactin levels remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of abnormal prolactin levels and identify the factors influencing serum prolactin levels in pediatric and adolescent patients treated with antipsychotics in a real-world clinical setting. Method: This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at Nagoya University Hospital and included consecutive 489 patients with psychiatric disorders aged <18 years who underwent serum prolactin monitoring. Because all hospitalized patients were included, sampling bias was minimized. Data on patient demographics, psychiatric diagnoses, medications, and prolactin levels were extracted and analyzed. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the factors influencing serum prolactin levels. Analysis of covariance was used to assess the effects of different antipsychotics on prolactin levels. Results: Hyperprolactinemia was observed in 23.0 % of patients treated with antipsychotics, whereas hypoprolactinemia was observed in 13.7 % of patients. Domperidone, sulpiride, and antipsychotics significantly increased prolactin levels. Risperidone, olanzapine, and blonanserin were associated with significantly increased serum prolactin levels, whereas aripiprazole was associated with hypoprolactinemia. Conclusion: Approximately 40 % of pediatric patients treated with antipsychotics exhibited abnormal prolactin levels. Clinicians should routinely monitor prolactin levels and consider prolactin-related side effects when prescribing antipsychotics to children and adolescents. These findings emphasize the importance of tailored antipsychotic therapy to minimize the adverse effects in this vulnerable population. © 2025 The Authors"

In this two-part study, we used quantitative and qualitative methods to: (1) assess incidence of optimal versus suboptimal transitions of care for AYA with DGBI, (2) characterize health and quality of life effects of the transition, and (3) identify barriers and facilitators for optimal transition of care. Methods: In Part 1, we conducted a retrospective review of AYA referrals to our adult neurogastroenterology clinic who had transitioned from pediatric gastroenterology care (N = 109, 17–23 years, 72% female). We collected demographic, psychosocial, and healthcare utilization data to determine rate and risk factors for suboptimal transitions. In Part 2, we recruited 24 AYA and parents (n = 19 AYA, n = 5 parents) for completion of a survey and semistructured interview, which was analyzed using validated rapid qualitative analysis method. Results: In Part 1, 20% (22/109) of AYA met the criteria for suboptimal transition of care, which was associated with treatment adherence concern and functional impairment. In Part 2, we identified two principal themes: (1) AYA's health and quality of life are impacted during the transition, and (2) parental involvement and collaboration with pediatric gastrointestinal are facilitators to successful transitions, whereas access to care and practice style change are barriers. Conclusion: AYA with DGBI have high rates of suboptimal care transitions, affecting their health and quality of life.

This study aimed to (1) assess the measurement invariance of a short DE scale among high school students in Canada, and (2) estimate differences in scale scores across student sociodemographic subgroups. Methods: We used student-level survey data collected during the 2021/2022 school year in the COMPASS study. The sample included 24,639 students in grades 9–12 from 69 secondary schools in Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario, Canada. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis was applied to assess measurement invariance (i.e., configural, metric, scalar, and strict invariance) of the 6-item DE scale, and one-way ANOVA and mixed linear regression were implemented to estimate scale score differences across population subgroups (by grade, gender, race and ethnicity, family affluence, and weight status). Results: Results demonstrated full measurement invariance of the DE scale across student sociodemographic subgroups. Higher sum scale scores indicated greater engagement in DE thoughts or behaviours. Students in higher school grade (e.g., grade 12), transgender and gender diverse youth, and cisgender girls reported higher DE scores compared to their grade 9 and cisgender boy peers. Elevated DE scores were also observed among adolescents of Middle Eastern and Another or Multiethnic identity, students with less affluent households, and those with higher body weights, relative to their White, more affluent, and relatively lower weight peers, respectively. Conclusions: Results indicate the DE scale measures the same construct across various subgroups of adolescents, providing confidence that differences in scale scores found by grade, gender, race and ethnicity, affluence, and weight reflect actual differences in DE rather than artifactual differences in scale interpretation. This scale warrants additional psychometric testing as a promising brief DE measure suitable for large population-level youth surveys. Our results provide important new evidence from a large contemporary sample of adolescents demonstrating elevated risk of DE among specific subgroups and emphasizing the need for targeted interventions. © The Author(s) 2025."

Yet, our knowledge of gender dysphoria and related outcomes is restricted due to the lack of high-quality studies employing comprehensive approaches. This longitudinal study aims to enhance our knowledge of gender dysphoria; different aspects will be scrutinised, focusing primarily on the psychosocial and mental health outcomes, prognostic markers and, secondarily, on the underlying mechanisms for its origin. Methods and analysis The Swedish Gender Dysphoria Study is an ongoing multicentre longitudinal cohort study with 501 registered participants with gender dysphoria who are 15 years old or older. Participants at different phases of their clinical evaluation process can enter the study, and the expected follow-up duration is three years. The study also includes a comparison group of 458 age- and county-matched individuals without gender dysphoria. Data on the core outcomes of the study, which are gender incongruence and experienced gender dysphoria, body satisfaction and satisfaction with gender-affirming treatments, as well as other relevant outcomes, including mental health, social functioning and life satisfaction, are collected via web surveys. Two different research visits, before and after starting on gender-affirming hormonal treatment (if applicable), are planned to collect respective biological and cognitive measures. Data analysis will be performed using appropriate biostatistical methods. A power analysis showed that the current sample size is big enough to analyse continuous and categorical outcomes, and participant recruitment will continue until December 2022. Ethics and dissemination The ethical permission for this study was obtained from the Local Ethical Review Board in Uppsala, Sweden. Results of the study will be presented at national and international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals.

Methods Data were from 92,757 undergraduate students aged 18–24 enrolled in 216 colleges between Fall 2021 and Fall 2022, from the American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment III. Regression models were used to estimate alcohol, cannabis, tobacco, and disordered eating risk among those with OCD related conditions compared to those without conditions, overall and by sex/gender, while adjusting for covariates and school clustering. Results Students with OCD conditions displayed a higher prevalence of substance use and disordered eating risks. In adjusted models, OCD conditions were associated with increased odds of moderate/high tobacco (aOR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.05, 1.21), cannabis (aOR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.04, 1.18), alcohol (aOR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.05, 1.24) and disordered eating risk (aOR = 2.28, 95% CI 2.13, 2.43). Analyses stratified by gender revealed cis-female students with OCD conditions were at increased risk for moderate/high risk alcohol (aOR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.08, 1.29), tobacco (aOR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.03, 1.22), cannabis (aOR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.06, 1.23) and disordered eating (aOR = 2.30, 9%% CI 2.14, 2.47). Among TGNC students, OCD conditions were associated with increased risk for moderate/high tobacco risk (aOR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.05, 1.48) and disordered eating (aOR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.85, 2.47). OCD conditions was only associated with disordered eating among male students (aOR = 2.34, 95% CI 1.93, 2.83). Discussion Young adult college students with OCD conditions exhibit a higher prevalence of medium/ high risk alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use and disordered eating compared to their counterparts without such conditions, even after adjusting for stress, depression, and anxiety. © 2025 Jacobs et al.

The current study evaluated which emotions (i.e., distress, fear, and moral emotions) were most strongly linked to feeling fat and tested feeling fat as a longitudinal mediator of the relationship between these emotions and restricting or binge eating (https://osf.io/3d5cq/). Method: Community adults (N = 714, M[SD] age = 41.5[13.7], 84.6% female, 85.9% white) provided data at baseline, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up. Relative weights analysis examined which emotion categories exhibited the strongest longitudinal relationships with feeling fat. Cross-lagged panel models tested feeling fat as a mediator of the relationship between emotions and eating disorder behaviors. Results: Distress and moral emotions were the strongest emotional predictors of feeling fat. Feeling fat predicted binge eating (p's < 0.001), but not restricting (p's ≥ 0.832), in random effects cross-lagged panel models. Feeling fat partially mediated the longitudinal relationship between distress and binge eating (p = 0.044); however, this effect became nonsignificant after adjusting for BMI (p = 0.354). Feeling fat did not mediate relationships between moral emotions and binge eating or between either distress or moral emotions and restricting (p's ≥ 0.638). Discussion: Feeling fat was associated with binge eating, not restricting, highlighting the importance of specificity in maintenance models. Because the mediating effect of feeling fat was accounted for by body size, factors associated with body size, such as internalized weight stigma, may be more relevant mediators of the relationship between negative emotions and eating disorder behaviors. Future research on feeling fat should adjust for body size. © 2024 The Author(s). International Journal of Eating Disorders published by Wiley Periodicals LLC."

The current clinical approach to feeding and eating disorders aimed to increase personalization of management. . https://doi.org/10.1002/wps.21263","Feeding and eating disorders (FEDs) are a heterogeneous grouping of disorders at the mind-body interface, with typical onset from childhood into emerging adulthood. They occur along a spectrum of disordered eating and compensatory weight management behaviors, and from low to high body weight. Psychiatric comorbidities are the norm. In contrast to other major psychiatric disorders, first-line treatments for FEDs are mainly psychological and/or nutrition-focused, with medications playing a minor adjunctive role. Patients, carers and clinicians all have identified personalization of treatment as a priority. Yet, for all FEDs, the evidence base supporting this personalization is limited. Importantly, disordered eating and related behaviors can have serious physical consequences and may put the patient's life at risk. In these cases, immediate safety and risk management considerations may at least for a period need to be prioritized over other efforts at personalization of care. This paper systematically reviews several key domains that may be relevant to the characterization of the individual patient with a FED aimed at personalization of management. These domains include symptom profile, clinical subtypes, severity, clinical staging, physical complications and consequences, antecedent and concomitant psychiatric conditions, social functioning and quality of life, neurocognition, social cognition and emotion, dysfunctional cognitive schemata, personality traits, family history, early environmental exposures, recent environmental exposures, stigma, and protective factors. Where possible, validated assessment measures for use in clinical practice are identified. The limitations of the current evidence are pointed out, and possible directions for future research are highlighted. These also include novel and emerging approaches aimed at providing more fine-grained and sophisticated ways to personalize treatment of FEDs, such as those that utilize neurobiological markers. We additionally outline remote measurement technologies designed to delineate patients’ illness and recovery trajectories and facilitate development of novel intervention approaches. © 2025 World Psychiatric Association."

However, this research has mostly been conducted with binary transgender people. Here, we examine how non-binary people experience and relate to their bodies. Semi-structured one-on-one interviews were conducted with 13 gender non-binary individuals living in Australia. Photo elicitation techniques were utilised, and the transcribed interview data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Six themes were identified: Expansive Understandings of Body Image, Body Image can be Linked to Gender Dysphoria, Cultivating a Preferred Body can Lead to Gender Euphoria, Appreciating Diversity in Non-Binary Body Ideals, The Androgynous Body Ideal is not Universally Accepted, and Experiencing the Body as Functional rather than Aesthetic. The present findings highlight the diversity of experiences of body image for non-binary people. The non-binary concept of body image was found to be expansive, stressing various physical attributes involved in social gender recognition and physiological sources of gender dysphoria. Some participants valued gender-affirming medical intervention, others were accepting of their bodies as they are, attributing their body confidence to the process of affirming their non-binary gender. © 2024 The Authors"

Compass—canada’s first child psychiatry access program: implementation and lessons learned. . https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0323199","Background There is a lack of mental health and substance use providers for youth in BC, particularly in rural and remote areas. To address these gaps, Canada’s first child psychiatry access program, BC Children’s Hospital Compass Program, was developed in 2018 to support providers across the province in providing evidence-based mental health and substance use care to youth under 25. This article describes the program’s first five years and provides an overview of its creation, utilization, and clinical uses. Methods Quantitative data collected by the Compass Program from September 2018 through September 2023 were analyzed. Participation and utilization of the service by providers in the province were analyzed and descriptive statistics, including means with standard deviations for quantitative variables have been used to describe demographic and other medical factors related to participants. Findings A total of 2336 new providers have been enrolled since Compass’ inception. Number of clinical calls into Compass remained steady over the five-year period with an average of 1085 individual providers served per year. Service use is highest in Vancouver Coastal Region (27.3%), followed by Northern Health (21.4%), Interior (15.7%), Vancouver Island (14.5%), and Fraser (13.4%), and Yukon (0.3%). General practitioners make up over a third of all encounters (34.6%), followed closely by pediatrician encounters making up 27.5% of total encounters from 2018–2023. These two provider types comprise over 60% of all encounters over the 5-year timespan. Encounters with other provider types were less common, with the third most common encounter being Child and Youth Mental Health (CYMH) clinicians, totalling 8.6% of total encounters. 37.6% of encounters were for male patients and 42.9% for female patients with 6.8% reporting “Other” genders and 12.7% declining to answer. Medication concerns are the most common reason for accessing Compass, regardless of gender. Therapy questions, resource coordination issues, and diagnostic clarification followed in frequency, comprising a similar amount of consults. Compass consultations have the potential to benefit three groups of people: the specific patient being consulted on, the provider requesting the consultation, as well as the provider’s colleagues who might benefit from peer consultation. Conclusions Capacity building is important given Compass receives calls from rural and remote areas where there are no psychiatrists or child psychiatrists where general practitioners and clinicians regularly work with patients along the entire spectrum of mental health and substance use disorders. © 2025 Tsang et al.

Methods: Electronic medical records from nine healthcare systems participating in the Mental Health Research Network were aggregated to form a retrospective case–control study, with ICD-9 codes used to identify diagnoses in the 1 year prior to death by suicide for cases (N = 3330) or matching index date for controls (N = 297,034). Conditional logistic regression was used to assess differences in cancer and psychiatric diagnoses between cases and controls, controlling for sex and age. Results: Among patients without concurrent psychiatric diagnoses, cancer at disease sites with lower average 5-year survival rates were associated with significantly greater relative risk, while cancer disease sites with survival rates of >70% conferred no increased risk. Patients with most psychiatric diagnoses were at higher risk, however, there was no additional risk conferred to these patients by a concurrent cancer diagnosis. Conclusion: We found no evidence of a synergistic effect between cancer and psychiatric diagnoses. However, cancer patients with a concurrent psychiatric illness remain at the highest relative risk for suicide, regardless of cancer disease site, due to strong independent associations between psychiatric diagnoses and suicide. For patients without a concurrent psychiatric illness, cancer disease sites associated with worse prognoses appeared to confer greater suicide risk. © 2022 The Authors.

While associations of obesity and gender diversity have been identified, rates of gender diversity among adolescents with obesity remain unclear. The aim was to examine gender diversity among adolescents with obesity in a weight management programme. A single-centre cross-sectional questionnaire study was conducted. Eligible adolescents received the Gender Identity/GD Questionnaire for Adolescents and Adults (GIDYQ-AA), a validated instrument measuring gender diversity and GD. Gender identities, sexual orientations, questionnaire scores, and frequency of GD (GIDYQ-AA score <3) were determined. The relationship of GIDYQ-AA scores and BMI Z-score (BMIz) was assessed. Of 72 consenting youth, 29 assigned females (AF) and 17 assigned males (AM) completed GIDYQ-AA and demographic questions. Seventeen (59%) AF reported non-heterosexual orientations, and 6 (21%) reported non-cisgender identities. One (6%) AM reported non-cisgender identity. Two (4%) AF individuals had GD based on GIDYQ-AA scores. GIDYQ-AA scores did not correlate with BMIz. In conclusion, adolescents with obesity, particularly AF with non-heterosexual orientation, reported high rates of non-cisgender identity and GD. Routine screening for gender-related concerns in weight management settings may be warranted. © 2024 The Authors.

Suicide encompasses different phases, but for CSA survivors the salient factors precipitating suicide are rarely studied. In this study, from a progressive perspective of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB), we aim to identify distinct risk factors for predicting different stages of STB, i.e., suicidal ideation (SI), suicide plan (SP), and suicide attempt (SA), among young adults with CSA experience. Based on mental health profiles of 4,070 young adult CSA survivors from a cross-sectional survey, we constructed five random forest classification models to respectively classify high suicidality, SI, SP, and SA. The common crucial factors for predicting SI, SP, and SA included NSSI and depression. The special important predictors for SI included OCD, anxiety, PTSD, and social rhythm. Co-occurrence of other types of childhood abuse and traumatic events was a special important predictor for SP among participants with SI. Self-compassion was the most crucial factor in classifying SA from those with SI. Social rhythm, co-occurrence of other types of childhood abuse, domestic violence, fear of happiness, and self-compassion made specific contribution to the prediction of SI, SP, and SA. However, the random forest model failed to accurately classify SA from those with SP, which was consistent with existing research. Our findings highlighted the importance of identifying suicidal characteristics for specified interventions at different stages of suicide for young people with CSA experiences. © The Author(s) 2025."

Assessment of treatment impact has been based on the assumption that without intervention, BMD Z-scores remain stable. However, the natural course of BMD in this population is unknown. Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study. Methods: Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans prior to medical intervention were included from 333 individuals assigned male at birth (AMAB) and 556 individuals assigned female at birth (AFAB) aged 12-25 years. The relationship between age and BMD Z-scores of sex assigned at birth was analysed for the lumbar spine (LS), total hip (TH), femoral neck (FN), and total-body-less-head (TBLH), adjusted for height SDS, height-adjusted lean mass Z-score, and whole body percentage fat Z-score. Results: In individuals AMAB, the BMD Z-score was negatively associated with age between 12 and 22 years: LS -0.13/year (95% confidence interval, CI -0.17; -0.10); TH -0.05/year (95% CI -0.08; -0.02); FN -0.06/year (95% CI -0.10; -0.03); and TBLH -0.12/year (95% CI -0.15; -0.09). Adjusting for height-adjusted lean mass Z-score attenuated the association at the LS and TBLH and eliminated the association at the TH and FN. BMD Z-scores and age were not associated between 22 and 25 years. In individuals AFAB, BMD Z-scores were only associated with age at the TBLH (-0.08/year, 95% CI -0.12; -0.04) between age 12 and 20 years. Conclusion: In individuals AMAB aged 12-22 years prior to any treatment, BMD Z-scores were inversely correlated with age. This could imply that BMD increases less in individuals AMAB than in the general population, and that changes in Z-score during puberty suppression and subsequent hormone supplementation are not necessarily due to treatment, but possibly related to lifestyle factors. © 2024 The Author(s)."

Method: Open text (survey) responses of Dutch and Flemish SGM emerging adults (n = 187) were thematically analysed using the constant comparative comparison method for qualitative analysis. Results: We identified 8 themes in our qualitative analysis. Two themes fell within the scope of the minority stress framework that has received little attention: (1) concerns about relationships and family planning and (2) feeling different (internal stressor). Two additional themes emerged largely beyond the scope of existing minority stress framework studies on suicidality: (3) SGM-related questioning; (4) negativity in LGBT communities. Four established minority stress framework themes emerged: (5) gender identity stress; (6) victimization; (7) coming-out stress; (8) psychological difficulties linked to SGM status. Conclusion: Suicide prevention needs to focus on supporting SGM emerging adults who worry about feeling “different”, or who have concerns over their romantic and family life, on reducing gender minority stress, as well as on caring for those who are victimized due to their sexual or gender identity. © The Author(s) 2023."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of internet overuse and psychiatric disorders in adolescents who applied to the child psychiatry outpatient clinic after the distance education period. Materials and Methods: A semi-structured tool, “Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version” (K-SADS-PL) was used to assess psychiatric diagnoses and Young Internet Addiction Test (IAT) to determine excessive internet usage. A total of 141 adolescents aged 11-18 years were recruited for this study. Results: The average score for IAT was statistically significantly higher in the youths with social anxiety disorder compared to those without (p=0.001) even after controlling for socioeconomic status (SES) (p=0.007). According to the hierarchical regression analyses, the girl gender (B=-6.899, p=0.029), younger age (B=-1.526, p=0.032) and co-morbidity of OCD (B=5.292, p=0.042) have statistically significantly predicted higher IAT scores in adolescents diagnosed with anxiety disorders. Conclusion: Identifying the common psychiatric diagnoses related to pathological internet use in adolescents, who started face-to-face education after a long break would enable mental health professionals to plan appropriate interventions for problematic areas particularly in vulnerable population more quickly when similar outbreaks recur. © 2023, Galenos Publishing House.

One way to enhance outcomes is to further our understanding of adolescent depression and improve our capacity to target the most frequently reported and problematic symptoms. A common but often neglected symptom of depression is fatigue, which is associated with considerable impairment and has the potential to interfere with adolescents’ engagement in psychological therapies. Despite this, the experience of fatigue in adolescent depression and how we target it in treatment is currently poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to explore adolescents’ experiences and understandings of fatigue in depression, recruiting from clinical and community settings. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 UK-based adolescents aged 14–18 years old with elevated symptoms of depression. Using reflexive thematic analysis, three themes were generated. Fatigue is a complex concept explored adolescents’ understanding of fatigue as a dynamic, multifaceted symptom which had mental and physical components. Trapped in a cycle of fatigue considered the complex and reciprocal relationship between fatigue and other depressive symptoms, and the subsequent impact of limited energy on engagement with everyday activities. Finally, stigma as a barrier to help-seeking highlighted how adolescents were reluctant to seek help due to experienced stigma and the perception that fatigue was not a serious enough symptom. Findings from this study suggest that fatigue should be viewed as a psychological as well as somatic symptom of depression, with implications regarding the identification and treatment of fatigue in depression in routine clinical practice. © The Author(s) 2023."

(2024). How experiences of stigma and discrimination at various points in the queer life course interrelate with alcohol use: views from sexually and gender diverse youth. . https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph21111472","Background: The life courses of sexually and gender diverse individuals are shaped by a series of events that include acceptance of one’s own sexual orientation or gender identity, the coming out process and socialization in the LGBTQ+ (for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer/Questioning, and other sexual orientations and gender identities represented by the plus sign) environment. Generally experienced in a cis-heteronormative context, this process is marked by stigma and discrimination and the social harms they can cause, including a higher-than-average prevalence of alcohol use. Objectives: To profile the alcohol use of sexually and gender diverse (SGD) youth from a life course perspective and to explore individual perceptions regarding the personal, social and cultural factors (including stigmatization and its consequences) modulating their consumption. Methodology: This qualitative descriptive study is grounded in symbolic interactionism. Semi-structured interviews lasting approximately 90 min were conducted with LGBTQ+ youth aged 18 to 30 using alcohol at least once a week. A thematic analysis was performed. Results: A total of 31 individuals aged 18–29 (average age: 25) were interviewed. The average score regarding alcohol use was 14.25 (Standard Deviation -SD-: 4–31), which corresponds to a moderate risk and indicates the need for a brief intervention. Our study documents how the higher alcohol use among LGBTQ+ youth is shaped by individual, community and cultural factors at different points in the queer life course. Among the factors influencing drinking are the emotions experienced when questioning sexual orientation and/or gender identity as well as the feelings resulting from stigma and discrimination. Our findings also indicate the influence of socializing in the queer community and meeting peers and partners, as well as that of LGBTQ+ cultural practices. Discussion: Our study indicates the need for grassroots-level interventions that work to mitigate social pressures in queer socialization contexts. Accordingly, any intervention, whether preventive or therapeutic, must consider the interplay of personal, social, community and cultural factors. Interventions regarding alcohol use must build on the strengths of community and the sense of belonging. © 2024 by the authors."

Endocrine health and health care disparities in the pediatric and sexual and gender minority populations: an endocrine society scientific statement. . https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgad124","Endocrine care of pediatric and adult patients continues to be plagued by health and health care disparities that are perpetuated by the basic structures of our health systems and research modalities, as well as policies that impact access to care and social determinants of health. This scientific statement expands the Society's 2012 statement by focusing on endocrine disease disparities in the pediatric population and sexual and gender minority populations. These include pediatric and adult lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual (LGBTQIA) persons. The writing group focused on highly prevalent conditions - growth disorders, puberty, metabolic bone disease, type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D) diabetes mellitus, prediabetes, and obesity. Several important findings emerged. Compared with females and non-White children, non-Hispanic White males are more likely to come to medical attention for short stature. Racially and ethnically diverse populations and males are underrepresented in studies of pubertal development and attainment of peak bone mass, with current norms based on European populations. Like adults, racial and ethnic minority youth suffer a higher burden of disease from obesity, T1D and T2D, and have less access to diabetes treatment technologies and bariatric surgery. LGBTQIA youth and adults also face discrimination and multiple barriers to endocrine care due to pathologizing sexual orientation and gender identity, lack of culturally competent care providers, and policies. Multilevel interventions to address these disparities are required. Inclusion of racial, ethnic, and LGBTQIA populations in longitudinal life course studies is needed to assess growth, puberty, and attainment of peak bone mass. Growth and development charts may need to be adapted to non-European populations. In addition, extension of these studies will be required to understand the clinical and physiologic consequences of interventions to address abnormal development in these populations. Health policies should be recrafted to remove barriers in care for children with obesity and/or diabetes and for LGBTQIA children and adults to facilitate comprehensive access to care, therapeutics, and technological advances. Public health interventions encompassing collection of accurate demographic and social needs data, including the intersection of social determinants of health with health outcomes, and enactment of population health level interventions will be essential tools.  © 2023 The Author(s).

Mentalizing, epistemic trust and interpersonal problems in emotion regulation: a sequential path analysis across common mental health disorders and community control samples. . https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2024.12.050","Background: Emotion regulation is a crucial function implicated in multiple mental health disorders; understanding the mechanisms by which emotion regulation has such impact is essential. Mentalizing has been posited as a prerequisite for effective emotion regulation. The current study aims to examine the roles of epistemic trust and interpersonal problems in driving the association between mentalizing and emotion regulation, contrasting clinical and non-clinical populations. Method: A total of 652 individuals (296 clinical and 356 community control) were employed. Sequential mediation analysis was used to examine the role of epistemic stances and interpersonal problems in the mentalizing-emotion regulation link, and moderated mediation analysis was conducted to identify group differences in these pathways. Results: Ineffective mentalizing was associated with emotion dysregulation and interpersonal problems. Higher levels of epistemic credulity and mistrust were associated with ineffective mentalizing, interpersonal problems, and emotion dysregulation. Sequential mediation analysis indicated that disruptions in epistemic trust (epistemic mistrust and credulity) and interpersonal problems partially mediated the relationship between inadequate mentalizing and emotion dysregulation, with these pathways being consistent across both clinical and control groups. The pathways including epistemic trust were not significant. Limitations: The study's limitations include a simplified theoretical model, a cross-sectional design preventing causal inference, and sample recruitment methods possibly limiting generalizability. Conclusions: These findings suggest a potential mechanism connecting mentalizing, disruptions in epistemic trust, interpersonal problems, and emotion regulation, to illuminate a crucial aspect of psychological functioning. These results emphasize the significance of social-communicative aspect in clinical outcomes. © 2024 The Authors"

(2025). Adopted transgender subjects are overrepresented and have a different psychosocial profile than their non-adopted counterparts: a case-control study. . https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0322201","Background The factors driving the global increase in the number of transgender individuals remain unclear. It has been suggested that early-life events may interact with biological predispositions, yet little research has explored specific early-life circumstances that might contribute to gender incongruence. One such factor is adoption, as a few pediatric gender identity clinics have reported an overrepresentation of adoptees. However, no study has systematically examined whether this trend extends to adult transgender health centers, nor has the psychosocial profile of adopted transgender individuals been characterized in adulthood. Aims and methods This retrospective study was conducted in two phases to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of adoptees among adult transgender patients seeking gender-affirming therapy. In Phase 1, we analyzed a cohort of 671 new adult subjects presenting between 2015 and 2021. In Phase 2, the nested case-control analysis, the 15 adoptees identified were matched in a 1:4 ratio with non-adopted controls based on age, assigned sex at birth, and presentation timing. Data on demographics, psychosocial factors, psychiatric diagnoses, and parental support were extracted from electronic records, and augmented by telephone interviews when needed. Results Adoptees constituted 2.2% of the clinic population, an order of magnitude higher than the national rate (P < 0.0001), with an unprecedented assigned-female-at-birth (AFAB) ratio of 73.3%. After matching, 60% of adoptees had at least one psychiatric co-morbidity, almost twice the rate of non-adopted controls (OR = 3.23, 95% CI: 1.02–10.21, P=0.042). Despite coming from higher socioeconomic status homes (P<0.001), adoptees had lower odds of achieving college education (P=0.031), and receiving full parental support for transition (OR=0.20, 95% CI: 0.05–0.71, P=0.015). Notably, 28.6% of adoptees had attempted suicide vs 3.3% of non-adopted controls (OR=11.6, 95% CI: 1.87–71.97, P=0.01). Conclusions Adopted transgender individuals represent a vulnerable subgroup within the transgender population, characterized by unique psychosocial challenges. Our findings underscore the importance of tailored interventions and heightened support within transgender health clinics for adoptees seeking gender-affirming therapy. Further research is warranted to elucidate the interplay of adoption, biological predispositions, and social factors in the development of gender incongruence. © 2025 Yaish et al.

Its prevalence in the child and adolescent population varies between 0,6-1,7 %, with a significant increase in recent years, observed both in Chile and internationally. The objective of this research is to describe sociodemographic characteristics and psychiatric comorbidity in Boys, Girls and Adolescents with GD in Chilean hospitals. Method: quantitative, descriptive and retrospective study. The sample was 38 patients under 18 years of age with GD. The variables were analyzed: sex, gender identity, age, age at diagnosis and prevalence of comorbidities, coded according to DSM-5 and ICD-10. The analysis of measures of central tendency and dispersion was carried out with PASW Statistics 18. Results: the average age at diagnosis was 14 years. 100 % had comorbidity, the most frequent being depressive episodes (68,4 %), attempted self-elimination (50 %) and eating disorder (34,2 %). An average of 2,8 comorbidities per subject was determined. 21,1 % of the subjects presented critical psychiatric multimorbidity (four simultaneous diagnoses). Conclusions: there is a high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities in adolescents with GD, highlighting mood disorders, anxiety, self-harming behaviors, suicide attempts and eating disorders, there being a need for a multidisciplinary approach that considers gender identity and serious comorbidities. © 2024; Los autores."

While literature on EDs in TGE populations is growing and evolving, best practice guidelines are scant. A framework for providing gender-affirming care (GAC) in an ED treatment setting was developed by integrating findings from a focused literature review and insights from leading experts. Following synchronous and asynchronous training, the protocol was implemented in a virtual ED treatment setting with a national reach serving patients ages 6–24 years. This paper offers a summary of best practices and approaches for providing GAC in ED treatment settings. The use of GAC practices has the potential to address underlying issues and inequities in treatment delivery and outcomes. We encourage ED treatment providers to consider the adoption/adaptation of GAC best practices to more effectively meet the needs of TGE patients. More research is needed to better understand the influence of individual and collective GAC practices on specific ED treatment outcomes. © 2024 The Author(s).

A variety of dietary interventions are used in practice, but little is known about their effectiveness. We compared clinical outcomes of patients (N = 100) undergoing eating disorder treatment, and user experience across two virtually delivered interventions: (1) Daily calorie target and (2) Plate-by-Plate™ approach. The calorie group gained more weight on average, though the difference was small (β = 1.62 [−0.02, 3.26]). Participants in both groups improve their eating disorder symptoms at roughly the same rate (β = 0.09 [−0.83, 1.04]). Caregivers in the Plate-by-Plate group increased confidence at a slower rate (β = 0.05 [−0.002, 0.09]).

Multiple modified Poisson and linear regression analyses were conducted to determine the associations between any dieting and eating disorder attitudes and behaviors. Among the sample, 15.7 % of girls and women, 10.4 % of boys and men, and 13.0 % of transgender/gender expansive (TGE) participants reported any dieting in the past 12 months, with the Ketogenic diet being most common among all genders. Results from regression analyses showed that engaging in any dieting in the past 12 months was associated with greater eating disorder psychopathology among girls, women, boys, and men, but not TGE participants. There were varying trends in association between specific types of dieting practices and eating disorder behaviors among girls, women, boys, and men. Dieting is relatively common among a national sample of Canadian adolescents and young adults, and engagement is associated with greater eating disorder psychopathology and behaviors.

However, despite evidence of efficacy, apps have yet to be widely adopted and integrated into clinical practice. This study sought to understand mental health clinicians’ practices and perspectives of eating disorder apps. One-hundred-eighteen mental health clinicians (67 % Psychologists, 10 % Psychiatrists, 10 % Counsellors, 6 % Psychiatric Nurses; 7 % other) responded to a survey assessing current practices, knowledge, and attitudes related to apps in practice. Nearly two-thirds of clinicians (63 %) had used/discussed apps with clients; the most common reasons were that apps complement their services (80 % endorsed) and are efficient methods for monitoring symptoms and progress (89 % endorsed). The most common reason for clinicians who had not used/discussed apps with clients was not knowing which apps were appropriate to recommend (82 % endorsed). Nearly 50 % of clinicians reported little to no knowledge of current eating disorder apps, as well as limited confidence in using them effectively in practice. However, 8 in 10 clinicians were open to incorporating apps in treatment, and most agreed that apps can be beneficial for psychoeducation, skill utilization, relapse prevention, and offering support when access to other help options is limited. Overall, findings show that clinicians are enthusiastic about the potential of apps to assist in the management of eating disorders, but clear barriers to their adoption and integration in practice remain.

Generally, those with no food insecurity reported the lowest ED psychopathology compared to higher ED psychopathology among those with food insecurity. Several unique differences were observed between cisgender men and cisgender women, while there were no significant associations between food insecurity and ED psychopathology found among transgender and gender nonconforming individuals. Further research is needed to investigate how the relationship between food insecurity and ED psychopathology differs based on gender, and to continue to explore food insecurity experienced beyond the COVID-19 pandemic as food insecurity possesses a considerable health threat to all. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

Loss of control eating in adults with impulsive and/or inattentive tendencies. . https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.70092","Objective: Previous research has tended to consider impulsive, inattentive, and loss of control eating (LOC) tendencies as symptoms of greater pathologies in treatment-seeking samples. However, inattentive and impulsive tendencies and LOC often co-occur. Although LOC is an important diagnostic component of disordered eating (ED), it has recently been argued to be a dysregulated eating behavior in its own right. The purpose of the current self-report study was, therefore, to investigate the association between impulsive and inattentive tendencies and LOC in adults after accounting for ED. Method: A community sample of 516 adults was surveyed online about their inattentive and impulsive tendencies, LOC, and ED behaviors. Results: A hierarchical multiple linear regression revealed ED, inattentive, and impulsive symptoms to be independent, significant, positive predictors of LOC. Discussion: These findings suggest that the levels of inattentive and, to a lesser extent, impulsive tendencies are significantly associated with LOC in adults, even after ED is accounted for. Moreover, inattentive tendencies were found to be more significantly associated with LOC than impulsive tendencies. These are novel and important findings that can be used to inform both clinicians and individuals with inattentive and impulsive tendencies alike of this association. Considering the well-documented adverse health and wellbeing outcomes associated with LOC, future feasibility trials are needed aimed at treating this co-occurrence. © 2024 The Author(s).

Examining teacher concerns and anxiety on the implementation of a universal body image program. . https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph21040419","In the past 30 years, there have been numerous positive body image and eating disorder prevention programs targeting youth developed for school-based settings. Frequently, teachers are used as interventionists to increase dissemination, decrease costs relative to researchers, and increase scalability. However, little is known about teacher concerns and barriers that may hinder successful uptake and implementation. The current study recruited a total of 269 teachers who consented to implement a universal body image and appearance-related bullying and teasing prevention program in their classrooms as part of a randomized controlled trial. Teachers expressed some worry that they may say the wrong thing, and concern about feeling uncomfortable teaching the program due to their own body dissatisfaction. Teacher’s ethnicity, gender, years teaching, dieting behaviors and other weight control behaviors, and self-efficacy were not associated with concerns related to teaching the curriculum. Teachers with lower body esteem reported higher concerns and anxiety related to teaching a body image curriculum. In free response items, teachers worried about handling student comments that were beyond the scope of the curriculum. Teacher self-efficacy was the only variable associated with the number of program sessions implemented. Findings suggest avenues to increase implementation. © 2024 by the authors."

This study aimed to assess the relationship between DSM-5 Alternative Model of Personality Disorder (AMPD) maladaptive personality facets and self-report dissociation in a sample of patients with BPD. Methods: Our sample consisted of 178 Italian adult patients who met the criteria for BPD diagnosed by Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV-Axis II. They were administered the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5) and the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES). An agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using facets as clustering variables. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify the PID-5 characteristics which could suggest a dissociative dimension. Results: Our results showed the potential of PID-5 to hypothesize a dissociative dimension towards DES scores. Therefore, we theorized a specific BPD phenotype characterized by high levels of Unusual Behaviors and Beliefs, high levels of Perceptual Dysregulation, high levels of Withdrawal, low levels of Impulsivity and Irritability, low levels of Callousness and low levels of Avoidance, for which it may be assumed a dissociative framework. Moreover, it could be postulated that patients with dissociative symptoms who will be diagnosed with BPD according to the AMDP would have the domain of Psychoticism as “specifier”. Lastly, we highlighted the role of gender as a moderator between personality traits and dissociative symptoms. Conclusion: Consistently with this study, an initial assessment with PID-5 personality facets may detect an underlying dissociative psychopathology, suggesting significant clinical implications for both treatment and prognosis. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Progesterone from ovulatory menstrual cycles is an important cause of breast cancer. . https://doi.org/10.1186/s13058-023-01661-0","Many factors, including reproductive hormones, have been linked to a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer (BC). We reviewed the literature regarding the relationship between ovulatory menstrual cycles (MCs) and BC risk. Physiological variations in the frequency of MCs and interference with MCs through genetic variations, pathological conditions and or pharmaceutical interventions revealed a strong link between BC risk and the lifetime number of MCs. A substantial reduction in BC risk is observed in situations without MCs. In genetic or transgender situations with normal female breasts and estrogens, but no progesterone (P4), the incidence of BC is very low, suggesting an essential role of P4. During the MC, P4 has a strong proliferative effect on normal breast epithelium, whereas estradiol (E2) has only a minimal effect. The origin of BC has been strongly linked to proliferation associated DNA replication errors, and the repeated stimulation of the breast epithelium by P4 with each MC is likely to impact the epithelial mutational burden. Long-lived cells, such as stem cells, present in the breast epithelium, can carry mutations forward for an extended period of time, and studies show that breast tumors tend to take decades to develop before detection. We therefore postulate that P4 is an important factor in a woman’s lifetime risk of developing BC, and that breast tumors arising during hormonal contraception or after menopause, with or without menopausal hormone therapy, are the consequence of the outgrowth of pre-existing neoplastic lesions, eventually stimulated by estrogens and some progestins. © 2023, The Author(s)."

However, the role of specific NSSI functions and the role of emotional valence in alexithymia, remain unclear. Thus, the present study investigated associations between lifetime-NSSI, alexithymia, and emotion regulation strategies (expressive suppression, cognitive reappraisal), focusing on NSSI functions and emotional valence in alexithymia. Methods: A total of 328 participants (M = 29.18 years, SD = 12.73) with and without lifetime-NSSI participated in the study. They completed online questionnaires regarding alexithymia, NSSI, and preferred emotion regulation strategies. A binominal logistic regression was computed to predict NSSI group assignment. Results: Participants with lifetime-NSSI reported significantly higher levels of alexithymia, more frequent use of expressive suppression, and less frequent use of cognitive reappraisal than those without NSSI. Alexithymia correlated with a higher tendency for expressive suppression and reduced cognitive reappraisal. Both positive and negative emotional alexithymia were linked to NSSI, with alexithymia significantly associated with stronger endorsement of intrapersonal-positive NSSI functions. Key predictors of NSSI group membership included younger age, lower use of cognitive reappraisal, and greater difficulty in appraising feelings. Limitations: The cross-sectional design precluded causal inferences. Conclusions: Findings reveal that individuals with lifetime-NSSI exhibit higher levels of alexithymia, favor expressive suppression as maladaptive emotion regulation strategy, and exhibit greater difficulty in adaptive cognitive reappraisal compared to those without NSSI. These findings underscore the importance to address emotion regulation and alexithymia in NSSI interventions. This is the first study to report a link between alexithymia and the endorsement of specific (intrapersonal-positive) NSSI functions. © 2025 The Author(s)"

Methods: A cross-sectional electronic survey was distributed to the global network of endocrine societies. Respondents’ professional and practice profiles, clinic sizes, their country of practice, and the impact of COVID-19 on endocrine diseases were investigated. Results: Respondents from 131 pediatric endocrine centers in 51 countries across all continents completed the survey. Routine check-ups and education were altered in most pediatric endocrine clinics. Over 20% of clinics experienced a shortage of critical medications or essential supplies. ICU treatment was required for patients with diabetes and COVID-19 in 21.2% of centers. In diabetes, 44% of respondents reported increased diabetic ketoacidosis episodes in newly diagnosed cases and 30% in established cases.

However, whether the three clusters of PDs have differences in comorbid mental disorders or gender distribution is still lacking sufficient evidence.

This study used the Taiwan national database between 1995 and 2013 to examine the data of patients with cluster A PDs, cluster B PDs, or cluster C PDs. We compared the differences of psychiatric comorbidities classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition across the three clusters of PDs. Moreover, we formed gender subgroups of the three PDs to observe the discrepancy between male and female. Among the 9845 patients, those with cluster A PDs had the highest proportion of neurodevelopmental disorders, schizophrenia and neurocognitive disorders, those with cluster B PDs demonstrated the largest percentage of bipolar disorders, trauma and stressor disorders, feeding and eating disorders, and substance and addictive disorders, and those with cluster C PDs had the greatest proportion of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive–compulsive disorders, somatic symptom disorders, and sleep–wake disorders. The gender subgroups revealed significant male predominance in neurodevelopmental disorders and female predominance in sleep–wake disorders across all three clusters of PDs. Our findings support that some psychiatric comorbidities are more prevalent in specified cluster PDs and that gender differences exist across the three clusters of PDs.

Sexual-minority stress is often discussed as a risk factor for the increased mental health problems reported in this population. Objective: The current study (1) investigated eating attitudes and depressive symptoms in a sexual minority sample from Turkey who identify themselves as LGBTIQ and (2) explored the role of sexual minority stressors beyond the potential predictors of eating attitudes and depressive symptoms in this population. Methods: Recruitment was supported and streamlined by several Turkish NGOs and LGBTIQ community networks. Sociodemographic measures, eating attitudes, depressive symptoms, sexual minority stressors (e.g., heterosexist experiences, internalized homophobia), and the potential predictors of eating attitudes and depressive symptoms were assessed with an anonymous online survey between February 2022 and June 2022. The sample consisted of 440 participants. The mean age was 31.92 (SD = 11.82). The majority of the participants reported their current gender identity as male (64.3%; n = 440) and their sexual orientation as attracted to men (62.8%; n = 439). For 79.7% of the participants, the assigned sex at birth was man (n = 439). Results: Two separate three-stage multiple hierarchical regression analyses were conducted, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and the risk and protective factors of eating attitudes and depressive symptoms. Disturbed eating attitudes were predicted by assigned female sex at birth, higher scores for depression, social isolation, and the total number of heterosexist experiences, and lower distress related to heterosexist experiences. Depressive symptoms were predicted by assigned female sex at birth, lesbian sexual orientation, disturbance in eating attitudes, increases in generalized anxiety, and distress related to daily heterosexist experiences. Conclusion: The current study demonstrated the significant role of sexual minority stressors in the prediction of disturbed eating attitudes and depressive symptomatology beyond the general psychosocial vulnerability factors. These findings emphasize the need for developing strategies to reduce prejudicial attitudes at the societal level and to enhance the skills of LGBTIQ individuals in coping with sexual minority stressors in Turkey.

Screening for eating disorders across genders in college students: initial validation of the brief assessment of stress and eating. . https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23815","Given that eating disorders (EDs) are relatively common in college populations, it is important to have reliable and valid tools to identify students so that they can be referred to evidence-based care. Although research supports the psychometric properties of existing ED screens for identifying cases of EDs, most studies have been conducted in samples of young white-majority women or have not reported the psychometric properties of the screening tool in men. Objective: The purpose of the current study was to validate a brief, 10-item screening tool for the identification of EDs—the brief assessment of stress and eating (BASE). Method: Participants were college students (N = 596; 68.2% cisgender women) from a large Midwestern university who completed the BASE and SCOFF. The Eating Disorders Diagnostic Survey was used to generate DSM-5 ED diagnoses. We evaluated area under the curve (AUC) for both receiver operating curves (ROC) and precision-recall curves (PRC). Results: Both the BASE and SCOFF performed significantly better than chance at identifying probable EDs in cisgender women (BASE AUC: ROC =.787, PRC =.633, sensitivity =.733, specificity =.697; SCOFF AUC: ROC =.810, PRC =.684, sensitivity =.793, specificity =.701). However, the BASE (AUC: ROC =.821, PRC =.605, sensitivity =.966, specificity =.495) significantly outperformed the SCOFF (AUC: ROC =.710, PRC =.354, sensitivity =.828, specificity =.514) for identifying probable EDs in cisgender college men. Discussion: The BASE is appropriate for student healthcare and college research settings. Because the BASE outperforms the SCOFF in college men, results from the current study are expected to contribute to improved identification of EDs on college campuses. Public Significance: The BASE is a new screening tool to identify eating disorders. The BASE performed as well as, if not better than, the SCOFF (particularly in men). Given the need for brief, psychometrically strong, and unbiased ED screening tools in college students, the current study helps address an unmet student healthcare need that we expect will contribute to improved identification of EDs on college campuses. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

A retrospective chart review of four gender minority youth (GMY), age 14-17, was performed for gender identity history, type and success of menstrual suppression, method satisfaction, side effects and improvement in menstrual distress. Menstrual suppression was successful in three patients, one patient discontinued use due to side effects that caused an increase in gender dysphoria. Menstrual distress and bleeding pattern improved in the majority of GMY in this series but side effects, as well as contraindications, may limit their use. In conclusion, menstrual dysphoria can be life-threatening for GMY and it is important that clinicians consider menstrual suppression in GMY with menstrual dysphoria. This series emphasizes the importance of individualized treatment plans. © 2022."

Youth may differ in the presence and severity of these underlying core features, and matching intervention strategies to such features may help personalize transdiagnostic interventions. We used latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify profiles of youth based on core underlying transdiagnostic dysfunctions and examined associations of profiles with treatment outcome. Method: LPA was conducted with 298 youth ages 7–18.8 (Mage = 12, SD = 3.2; 48.7% female; primarily White and Hispanic/Latinx) with a primary emotional disorder. Indicators for LPA included self-report measures of affect, anxiety sensitivity (AS), distress tolerance (DT), and emotion regulation (ER). Longitudinal associations between profile membership and treatment outcome were examined in a subset of 177 youth (Mage = 11.8, SD = 3.2; 52% female; primarily White and Hispanic/Latinx). Results: LPA identified three profiles characterized by differing levels of DT, affect, and ER. A Moderately Distressed and Dysregulated profile had the largest membership (65.1%) and poorer youth-reported anxiety and depression outcomes compared to a Distress Tolerant, Regulated Expressive profile (24.9%). A Distressed, High Affect Avoidant profile (10%) had the greatest baseline severity and the poorest depression outcomes, although most youth improved. Conclusions: Youth characterized by certain profiles of transdiagnostic core processes appear to have the poorest functioning and treatment prognosis, although most youth improved. Targeting these processes more directly and/or earlier in treatment may help to improve outcomes for youth © 2022. American Psychological Association"

The present study aimed to address these research gaps by examining whether pandemic-related changes in ED symptoms and mental healthcare prevalence differed for historically marginalized groups within a national sample of US college students. Method: Participants included 242,906 US college students (Mage = 23.45, SD = 7.04; MBMI = 25.28, SD = 5.91) who completed the repeated cross-sectional multi-institute Healthy Minds Study between January 2019 and May 2021. Moderated logistic regressions examined whether pandemic-related changes in individuals' likelihoods of exhibiting current probable ED, reporting lifetime ED diagnoses, and—among individuals with current probable ED—mental healthcare engagement differed for diverse gender, sexual, and racial/ethnic identity groups, and by body mass index (BMI) and financial stress. Results: There were increases of 5% and 12% in individuals' likelihoods of exhibiting current probable ED and symptomatic individuals' mental healthcare engagement, respectively, pre- to post-COVID-19 onset, but no pandemic-related changes in lifetime ED diagnosis prevalence. There were also important variations in these time-trends for different marginalized groups. For example, individuals identifying as genderqueer/gender nonconforming and lesbian exhibited increasing ED symptoms pre- to post-COVID-19 onset, and individuals with current probable ED and higher BMIs were increasingly likely to receive mental healthcare. Associations between financial stress, and the ED and mental healthcare outcomes did not change over time. Discussion: These findings provide insight into groups of US college students that experienced disproportionate ED burden during the pandemic at the population level, and directions for research and interventions that warrant consideration. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

Several studies have highlighted how this suffering has psychological, physical, and biological implications. This work aims to explore experiences related to body dissatisfaction and investigate the issues associated with living in a body perceived as incongruent for individuals with GI. Thirty-six individuals, aged between 18 and 30 years old and at stage T0 of hormone treatment, participated in the study. Body dissatisfaction and experiences related to it were investigated using the Clinical Diagnostic Interview. The Consensual Qualitative Research methodology was applied to the transcripts of the interviews. Several themes emerged: experiences with GI development, experiences with puberty and bodily changes, perception of one’s body, psychological problems and complex behavioral patterns related to body dissatisfaction. Results pointed out the complexity implied in the relationship with one’s body for individuals with GI, highlighting specific aspects of body dissatisfaction among these individuals (e.g., eating disorders, sexual difficulties, social withdrawal). This study underlines the need for a deeper understanding of some aspects of GI to better define guidelines for a correct assessment of it. In this way it will be easier to avoid negative outcomes for the psychological and general health of transgender people. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

We studied the somatic health, pubertal development, psychosocial background, and interest regarding gender-affirming surgical treatment of Finnish adolescents seeking gender-affirming hormonal treatment (GAHT). Methods: In this retrospective register study at an adolescent gynecology clinic in Helsinki University Hospital, Finland we included 124 adolescents diagnosed with GD and referred to GAHT between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2018. This cohort covered two thirds of all Finnish adolescents referred to GAHT during the follow-up. Data on the general adolescent population were obtained from the Finnish School Health Promotion (SHP) study of year 2017. Results: Most adolescents were assigned female at birth. Sex ratio increased from 1.2 in 2012 to 5.2 in 2017. One-third of the patients were overweight or obese (body mass index [BMI] >25 kg/m2). Other somatic comorbidities were rare. Interest toward reconstructive genital surgery was more common among male-to-female than female-to-male patients (80% vs. 22%, respectively, p<0.001). Depression (29%) and anxiety (19%) were common psychiatric comorbidities. Parental divorce rate (57%) was higher than in the general adolescent population in Finland (23%, p<0.001). Conclusion: Finnish adolescents diagnosed with GD-seeking GAHT have good somatic health, but a higher proportion of overweight, depression, and anxiety than the general adolescent population.

Longitudinal tracking of this cohort will allow investigation of the relationships between multiple outcome domains across the course of care. Subsets of Optymise have completed detailed neuropsychological and neurobiological assessments, permitting investigation of associations between these measures and longitudinal course. Participants Young people (aged 12-30) presenting to clinics coordinated by the BMC were recruited to a research register (n=6743) progressively between June 2008 and July 2018. To date, 2767 individuals have been included in Optymise based on the availability of at least one detailed clinical assessment. Measures Trained researchers use a clinical research proforma to extract key data from clinical files to detail social and occupational functioning, clinical presentation, self-harm and suicidal thoughts and behaviours, alcohol and other substance use, physical health comorbidities, personal and family history of mental illness, and treatment utilisation at the following time points: baseline, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months, and time last seen. Findings to date There is moderate to substantial agreement between raters for data collected via the proforma. While wide variations in individual illness course are clear, social and occupational outcomes suggest that the majority of cohort members show no improvement in functioning over time. Differential rates of longitudinal transition are reported between early and late stages of illness, with a number of baseline factors associated with these transitions. Furthermore, there are longitudinal associations between prior suicide attempts and inferior clinical and functional outcomes. Future plans Future reports will detail the longitudinal course of each outcome domain and examine multidirectional relationships between these domains both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and explore in subsets the associations between detailed neurobiological measures and clinical, social and functional outcomes. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Frontotemporal disorders: the expansive panoply of syndromes and spectrum of etiologies. . https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2023.1305071","Background: Frontotemporal lobe disorders (FTD) are amongst the most common brain neurodegenerative disorders. Their relatively covert, frequently subtle presentations and diverse etiologies, pose major challenges in diagnosis and treatments. Recent studies have yielded insights that the etiology in the majority are due to environmental and sporadic causes, rather than genetic in origin. Aims: To retrospectively examine the cognitive and behavioral impairments in the veteran population to garner the range of differing syndrome presentations and etiological subcategories with a specific focus on frontotemporal lobe disorders. Methodology: The design is a retrospective, observational registry, case series with the collection of epidemiological, clinical, cognitive, laboratory and radiological data on people with cognitive and behavioral disorders. Inclusion criteria for entry were veterans evaluated exclusively at Orlando VA Healthcare System, neurology section, receiving a diagnosis of FTD by standard criteria, during the observation period dated from July 2016 to March 2021. Frontotemporal disorders (FTD) were delineated into five clinical 5 subtypes. Demographic, cardiovascular risk factors, cognitive, behavioral neurological, neuroimaging data and presumed etiological categories, were collected for those with a diagnosis of frontotemporal disorder. Results: Of the 200 patients with FTD, further cognitive, behavioral neurological evaluation with standardized, metric testing was possible in 105 patients. Analysis of the etiological groups revealed significantly different younger age of the traumatic brain injury (TBI) and Gulf War Illness (GWI) veterans who also had higher Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) scores. The TBI group also had significantly more abnormalities of hypometabolism, noted on the PET brain scans. Behavioral neurological testing was notable for the findings that once a frontotemporal disorder had been diagnosed, the four different etiological groups consistently had abnormal FRSBE scores for the 3 principal frontal presentations of (i) abulia/apathy, (ii) disinhibition, and (iii) executive dysfunction as well as abnormal Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI) scores with no significant difference amongst the etiological groups. The most common sub-syndromes associated with frontotemporal syndromes were the Geschwind-Gastaut syndrome (GGS), Klüver-Bucy syndrome (KBS), involuntary emotional expression disorder (IEED), cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCA), traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES) and prosopagnosia. Comparisons with the three principal frontal lobe syndrome clusters (abulia, disinhibition, executive dysfunction) revealed a significant association with abnormal disinhibition FRSBE T-scores with the GGS. The regression analysis supported the potential contribution of disinhibition behavior that related to this complex, relatively common behavioral syndrome in this series. The less common subsyndromes in particular, were notable, as they constituted the initial overriding, presenting symptoms and syndromes characterized into 16 separate conditions. Conclusion: By deconstructing FTD into the multiple sub-syndromes and differing etiologies, this study may provide foundational insights, enabling a more targeted precision medicine approach for future studies, both in treating the sub-syndromes as well as the underlying etiological process.

Results showed that experiencing weight stigma in health care, experiencing differential treatment from others because of their diabetes, and engaging in self-stigma for diabetes and body weight were each significantly associated with increased frequency of binge eating and eating as a coping strategy to deal with negative feelings. Internalizing weight stigma was also significantly associated with lower levels of physical activity and worse self-rated health.

However, several transgender health guidelines propose an informed consent model of care to respect patient autonomy. This research aimed to understand, characterize, and asses the quality of information gathered through referral letters for patients consulting for gender-affirming surgeries. Methods: A retrospective review of electronic medical records (EMRs), including referral letters from behavioral health (BH) and primary care providers (PCPs), was conducted for patients seeking chest or genital surgery by a single surgeon between 2017 and 2019. Data were abstracted manually and included medical and gender history and documentation of WPATH-recommended surgical criteria. Results: A total of 233 patient records, including 171 PCP letters and 231 BH letters, were reviewed. With respect to documentation of surgical criteria, 92% of BH letters documented a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, 63% ability to provide informed consent, and 51% management of BH comorbidities. More than half of individuals with chronic physical health conditions did not have those conditions documented in their referral letters. Similarly, BH letters often failed to document BH diagnoses endorsed by patients. For example, while 80% of patients endorsed a diagnosis of anxiety, more than half did not have it documented in their letters. Overall, greater than half of diagnoses across BH conditions were only documented as present in the EMR. Conclusion: Referral letters only variably documented WPATH-recommended surgical criteria and did not reliably document physical and mental health comorbidities. Our research suggests that multidisciplinary pre-surgical assessment may be more useful than referral letters in some settings.  © 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2022."

Many children do not receive these recommended services, despite the known association between antipsychotic medications and metabolic dysfunction. The main objective of this study was to quantify the association among children's MH diagnosis categories, sociodemographic characteristics and receipt of first-line psychosocial care among children in Florida Medicaid Methods: Florida Medicaid enrollment, healthcare and pharmacy claims were used for this multivariate analysis. Children were assigned to condition clusters wherein related diagnoses were grouped into clinically relevant categories. A total of 7704 children were included in the final analysis. Results: Twenty-four percent of children in Florida Medicaid do not receive first-line, nonpharmacological psychosocial care. Age was significantly associated with not receiving psychosocial services, with older children less likely to receive. Non-Hispanic White children as well as those living in rural areas had lower odds of receiving behavioral intervention prior to initiating antipsychotics. Children with mood-disorders, behavior problems, anxiety and stress related disorders were more likely to receive first-line psychosocial care. Conclusions: This study provides an important understanding of the variability in receipt of first-line psychosocial care before antipsychotic medication initiation among children in Medicaid based on sociodemographic and MH health characteristics. These analyses can be used to develop quality improvement initiatives targeted toward children that are most vulnerable for not receiving recommended care. © 2021 Academic Pediatric Association"

Weight misperception and thin-ideal overvaluation relative to the positive functioning and eating disorder pathology of transgender and nonbinary young adults.. . https://doi.org/10.1037/sgd0000524","The present study examined associations among weight misperception (discrepancies between individuals’ perceived and actual weight statuses), thin-ideal overvaluation, positive mental health, and eating disorder symptoms in a large national sample of college and university students. Participants included 3,371 adult students from 78 campuses who identified as transgender or nonbinary (TNB) and completed the 2017–2018 or 2018–2019 waves of the cross-sectional multi-institute Healthy Minds Study. Via an online survey, participants completed validated measures assessing perceptual and cognitive-affective body image constructs, positive mental health, and eating disorder pathology. A structural equation model examined whether weight misperception (over and underperception) and thin-ideal overvaluation were associated with positive mental health and, in turn, eating disorder pathology. Whether these associations differed among individuals who identified as trans men, trans women, and genderqueer/gender nonconforming and individuals with self-identified TNB identities was examined via a multiple-group structural equation model. Overall, 35% of participants exhibited elevated eating disorder pathology. Overvaluation of the thin ideal and weight overperception, but not weight underperception, were associated with lower levels of positive mental health, which in turn was associated with elevated eating disorder pathology. These associations did not differ across the assessed TNB identity groups. These findings support the continued use of a positive psychological perspective in research seeking to explain the elevated risk for eating disorder pathology found among individuals with TNB identities. Screening individuals comprising these historically overlooked groups for the presence of weight overperception and thin-ideal overvaluation via brief screening forms during routine health care visits is recommended. © 2022 American Psychological Association"

Objective: To evaluate the association between strabismus and mental illness among children. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study analyzed claims data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse, a longitudinal deidentified commercial insurance claims database, from 12005189 patients enrolled in the health plan between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2017. Eligibility criteria included age younger than 19 years at the time of strabismus diagnosis, enrollment in the health plan between 2007 and 2018, and having at least 1 strabismus claim based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Controls were children in the same database with no eye disease codes other than refractive error reported. Demographic characteristics and mental illness claims were compared. Statistical analysis was conducted from December 1, 2018, to July 31, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: Presence of mental illness claims. Results: Among the 12005189 patients (6095523 boys [50.8%]; mean [SD] age, 8.0 [5.9] years) in the study, adjusted odds ratios for the association of mental illnesses with strabismus were 2.01 (95% CI, 1.99-2.04) for anxiety disorder, 1.83 (95% CI, 1.76-1.90) for schizophrenia, 1.64 (95% CI, 1.59-1.70) for bipolar disorder, 1.61 (95% CI, 1.59-1.63) for depressive disorder, and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.97-1.02) for substance use disorder. There was a moderate association between each strabismus type (esotropia, exotropia, and hypertropia) and anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depressive disorder; odds ratios ranged from 1.23 (95% CI, 1.17-1.29) for the association between esotropia and bipolar disorder to 2.70 (95% CI, 2.66-2.74) for the association between exotropia and anxiety disorder. Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study suggests that there was a moderate association between strabismus and anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depressive disorder but not substance use disorder. Recognizing that these associations exist should encourage mental illness screening and treatment for patients with strabismus. 2022 American Medical Association.

The relatively sudden, global emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic served as a massive stressor to virtually all people, regardless of infection status. This study hypothesized that actual and perceived stressors from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, in the categories of recurring disruptions, environmental threat, and social isolation would be positively associated with increased self-reported eating in the United States. Methods: Over 1100 English-fluent adults (52.8% women) living in the United States were recruited for a cross-sectional online survey about eating, COVID-19 consequences, and stress experiences. Linear regressions examined associations between perceived stress on five eating measures, and individual differences in personal/work situations, perceptions, and adverse experiences during the pandemic. Results: Anxiety, worry, and stress over, rather than direct consequences of, COVID-19 were most consistently associated with self-reported increased eating. Largely, these fell into the stressor categories of environmental threat and social isolation, not recurring disruptions. Body mass index and current self-reported eating pathology symptoms were also consistently associated with these outcomes. Conclusions: These correlational findings suggest specific stressors have pronounced influences on eating behavior of US adults. Remotely deliverable stress mitigation strategies should be explored to attenuate increased eating. © 2021 The Authors.

Perceptions and experiences with eating disorder treatment in the first year of <scp>covid</scp>‐19: a longitudinal qualitative analysis. . https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23888","Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic created significant challenges in accessing and receiving treatment for individuals with eating disorders (EDs). The purpose of this study is to explore perceptions of and experiences with ED treatment during the first year of the pandemic among individuals with past and self-reported EDs in the United States. Methods: Online surveys were administered to adults (N = 510) with a past or current self-reported ED at 13 timepoints between April 2020 and May 2021. Using longitudinal qualitative analysis, 5651 free-text responses were examined to capture experiences with ED treatment and generate inferences of change over time. Results: We categorized results into four sequential, temporal quarters and identified patterns that explained participants' perceptions of facilitators, barriers, and experiences with ED treatment over time: Quarter 1. Treatment Disruption and Reorienting Recovery; Quarter 2. Accumulating COVID-19 Stress and Virtual Treatment Woes; Quarter 3. A Continuation of Inadequate Care; and Quarter 4. Ongoing Adaptation and Adjustment to Uncertainty. Participant experiences were marked by numerous barriers to accessing care, challenges adjusting to virtual treatment, unmet treatment needs, and beginning acceptance of telehealth. Discussion: Our findings present a timeline to help evaluate challenges related to navigating the switch to virtual care which created significant disruption to ED recovery. Participants spent much of the first year trying to adjust to unemployment, loss of insurance, and lack of access to in-person treatment. Future research should identify additional strategies to improve the receipt and experience of care for EDs. Public Significance: Our findings suggest that individuals with eating disorders were significantly challenged by accumulating COVID-19 stress, worsening symptomatology, and limited access to effective treatment during the first year of the pandemic. This knowledge can guide clinicians, treatment centers, and policy makers in addressing the behavioral health needs of individuals impacted by disordered eating amidst emergent public health crises. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

Methods: We compared 64 individuals who self-identified as transgender and presented for SUD treatment to samples of cisgender men and women (separately) matched based on propensity scores which were created based on sociodemographic factors known to influence both the nature of substance use and patterns of treatment engagement including age, education, race, stable housing, and employment status. Comparisons were made using χ2 tests and t-tests in over 150 variables collected at treatment intake regarding physical and mental health, substance use patterns, events that led to treatment, reasons for seeking treatment, and treatment outcomes. Results: The transgender sample endorsed six of the seven suicide-related items more often than at least one of the cisgender-matched samples. Furthermore, the transgender sample remained in treatment significantly longer (M = 32.3, SD = 22.2) than the cisgender male sample (M = 19.5, SD = 26.1, t = 2.17, p = 0.03). Discussion: This study is a first step into understanding gender minority population experiences during SUD treatment. While there was no significant difference between the cisgender and transgender samples on most variables, there was an elevated prevalence of suicidal ideation and behaviors in the transgender sample, which warrants further investigation.

Methods: From the 2018 IBM® MarketScan® Commercial Database, there were 10,415 people identifiable as transgender based on International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) codes and procedure codes, specific to gender-affirming care, from inpatient and outpatient claims. Eating disorders were identified from ICD-10 codes and included anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, eating disorder not otherwise specified, avoidant restrictive feeding and intake disorder, and other specified feeding and eating disorders. We estimated the prevalence of specific eating disorders diagnoses by selecting patient characteristics. Results: Of individuals receiving some form of gender-affirming care, 2.43% (95% confidence interval: 2.14%–2.74%) were diagnosed with an eating disorder: 0.84% anorexia nervosa, 0.36% bulimia nervosa, 0.36% binge eating disorder, 0.15% avoidant restrictive feeding and intake disorder, 0.41% other specified feeding and eating disorders, and 1.37% with an unspecified eating disorder. Among transgender-identifiable patients aged 12–15 years, 5.60% had an eating disorder diagnosis, whereas 0.52% had an eating disorder diagnosis in patients aged 45–64 years. Discussion: In patients identifiable as transgender, with receipt of gender-affirming care, the prevalence of diagnosed eating disorders was low compared to extant self-reported data for eating disorder diagnosis in transgender individuals. Among this population, eating disorders were highest in adolescents and young adults. Clinically verified prevalence estimates for eating disorder diagnosis in transgender people with a history of gender-affirming care warrant further investigation. Public Significance: The present study aims to provide clinically validated, contemporary prevalence estimates for diagnosed eating disorders among a medically affirmed population of transgender adults and children in the United States. We report low prevalence of having any eating disorder relative to prevalence estimates reported in prior literature without clinical validation. These findings may be explained by access to affirming care and medical care generally. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

To date, however, little is known about the sociodemographic profile and health of transgender military personnel. Methods: U.S. Military personnel who self-identified as transgender completed anonymous online measures of demographics and military service. Participants also completed measures of health, mood, eating pathology, and risk behaviors. Results: One hundred ninety-five service members (mean age: 28.9±7.2 years, 48.7% transmale, 70.3% non-Hispanic White, 7.83±5.9 years in service) completed the survey. The majority of respondents first identified as transgender before military accession. Most had disclosed their gender identity to their command and providers, and had undertaken steps toward gender affirmation. The sample as a whole reported above average physical health, with mood symptoms within normal ranges and few reported risk behaviors. Analyses of covariance indicated that transmales reported significantly better mental health and psychosocial functioning compared with transfemales. Conclusion: In light of current policy that precludes, with limited exceptions, transgender individuals from serving in the U.S. Military in their affirmed gender, the current study provides an initial sociodemographic profile of this understudied population and indicates that transgender service members report above average physical health and few risk behaviors. Preliminary analyses indicated that transfemales in the military may be at higher risk for mental health concerns, compared with transmales.

Psychometric evaluation of the muscle dysmorphic disorder inventory (mddi) among gender-expansive people. . https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-022-00618-6","Purpose: Muscle dysmorphia is generally classified as a specific form of body dysmorphic disorder characterized by a pathological drive for muscularity and the preoccupation that one is too small or not sufficiently muscular. The majority of research on the condition has been conducted in cisgender men with a paucity of literature on gender minority people, a population that is at risk for muscle dysmorphia. One of the most widely used measures of muscle dysmorphia symptoms, the Muscle Dysmorphic Disorder Inventory (MDDI), has not been psychometrically validated for use in gender minority samples, the aim of the present study. Methods: We evaluated the psychometric properties of the MDDI in a sample of 1031 gender-expansive individuals (gender minority people whose gender identity differs from that assumed for their sex assigned at birth and is not exclusively binary man or woman) aged 18–74 who were part of The PRIDE Study, a large-scale, U.S., longitudinal cohort study. Results: Using a two-step, split-sample exploratory and confirmatory factor analytic approach, we found support for the original three-factor structure of the measure. The subscales showed adequate internal consistency, and convergent validity was supported based on significant associations of the MDDI subscale scores with theoretically related scores on a widely used measure of disordered eating. Conclusions: These findings provided novel support for adequate psychometric properties of the MDDI in a sample of gender-expansive individuals, facilitating the use of this measure in future research on muscle dysmorphia in this understudied and at-risk population. © 2022, The Author(s)."

Method: Parents of patients (10-18 yrs) referred to child and adolescent psychiatry participated in an anonymous online survey, approximately six weeks after the first easing of lockdown measures. Parents rated the amount, the content and the psychological impact of their children's media use before, during and after the lockdown. Results: N = 477 parents completed the survey. Patients showed a significant increase in media time during the lockdown (including devices such as mobile, tablet/PC, video game console, TV, and activities such as gaming, social media) and a moderate increase in the negative impact of media use on everyday life. After the lockdown, total media time returned to pre-COVID-19 levels in most patients, but remained slightly higher in males. A worsening of the main psychopathological problem during lockdown was related to elevated media time in children (10-13 yrs), but not in adolescents (14-18 yrs). Conclusion: According to parents' retrospective ratings, the increase in screen media time was reversible, and seems to reflect an expected coping strategy during lockdown. However, male patients did not completely return to pre-COVID-19 gaming time, and a small number continued to display excessive gaming. © 2021 The Authors"

Simultaneously, individuals with eating disorders reported increasing symptomology (Termorshuizen et al. in Int J Eat Disord. 53(11):1780–90, 2020). This study compares Emergency Department utilization at a pediatric quaternary-level care center by patients with eating disorders during the pandemic (March–Dec 2020) vs March-Dec 2019. We hypothesize that there was an increase in presentation of patients with eating disorders. An Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside query of the electronic medical record system identified patients with eating disorder diagnoses per ICD9/ICD10 codes aged 6–23 who presented to the Emergency Department between March 1st and December 31st of 2020 and 2019. Subsequent retrospective chart review was carried out. Patients were excluded from analysis if the presenting problem was not directly related to the eating disorder. During March–Dec 2019, 0.581% percent of all patients presented to the Emergency Department due to an eating disorder. During the same time frame in 2020, however, that percentage increased to 1.265%. Statistical significance was corrected using a Benjamini–Hochberg analysis. Despite a 66.5% decline in overall visits to the Emergency Department, the percentage of patients presenting with eating disorders doubled during the pandemic. During the pandemic, the total time spent awaiting placement significantly increased, and the number of patients identifying as transgender and/or nonbinary increased. Our data support the hypothesis that eating disorder presentation increased during the pandemic. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Methods: Analyses include data from 5,488 U.S. high school students from the 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys in four jurisdictions (Broward County, FL; Chicago, IL; Los Angeles, CA; San Diego, CA). Participants were 56% Hispanic/Latino, 21% black/African American, and 14% white. Two items asked about perceived gender expression; responses were classified into three groups: highly gender conforming (e.g., very masculine boys), moderately gender conforming, gender nonconforming (e.g., feminine boys). Sex-stratified multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association between gender expression, peer victimization, and DWCBs in previous month (fasting, using diet pills/liquids/powders, and purging [vomiting or using laxatives]), controlling for potential confounders. Results: Overall, 12% of respondents reported fasting, 6% reported diet pill use, and 5% reported purging, with significantly higher prevalence among gender nonconforming than among gender conforming male students (p <.001). In adjusted models, gender nonconforming male students had greater odds of fasting (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 3.0 [2.0–4.7]), diet pill use (6.1 [3.7–9.9]), and purging (7.2 [3.6–14.8]), relative to moderately conforming males. No significant associations were found among female students. Adding peer victimization to models modestly attenuated the association between gender nonconformity and DWCBs for male students. Conclusions: In probability samples of U.S. high school students, we observed marked differences by gender expression in DWCBs among male students but not among female students. Gender expression-related stigma should be addressed within clinical and school-based interventions to prevent DWCBs. © 2020 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine"

Examining ED pathology both across binary and minority-gender groups, and relative to racial/ethnic identification is necessary to inform screening and culturally-sensitive intervention efforts. This study investigated patterns of ED symptomology among youth and adults (N = 13658) who telephoned treatment centers in the United States when seeking clinical support for ED symptoms. Analyses examined data from participants who completed a semi-structured clinical interview. Results indicated that Anorexia nervosa was the most common diagnosis in each gender category and for a majority of race/ethnic groups; Black individuals had elevated rates of binge eating disorder. Compared to females, males were less likely to endorse all ED symptoms (ps <.001); gender minority status was also associated with decreased report of a majority of ED symptoms. Asian and Black individuals were less likely than Whites to endorse most ED symptoms. When compared to Whites, Hispanic/Latinx and Bi/Multi-racial participants did not demonstrate significant differences in presentation across a majority of ED symptoms. Overall findings suggest individuals with female gender and White race may seek treatment from an ED treatment facility with greater frequency than other demographic groups. Noted exceptions include Hispanic/Latinx and Bi/Multi-racial individuals, for whom ED pathology may be represented comparably to Whites. While findings confirm traditional patterns in gender and racial/ethnic representation in EDs, current study findings also underscore that EDs are not culture bound. © 2020 Association Française de Therapie Comportementale et Cognitive"

Influence of identity development on weight gain in adolescent anorexia nervosa. . https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.887588","Background: Anorexia Nervosa (AN) typically begins during early adolescence, an important phase of personality development. A substantial proportion of adolescent AN patients shows impaired personality functioning, which might be a relevant but understudied aspect of illness severity. The developmental status of identity as key element of personality is suggested to influence inpatient treatment outcome in adolescents with AN. Methods: This study analyzed existing data of N = 60 adolescents with AN. Multilevel models assessed the influence of identity functioning, measured by the Assessment of Identity Development in Adolescence (AIDA) at admission, on weight gain [BMI (body mass index), BMI-SDS (BMI standard deviation score)] during 10 weeks of inpatient treatment. Moreover, the influence of other indicators of illness severity, i.e., eating disorders and comorbid psychopathologies, was explored. Results: As expected, higher AIDA scores negatively influenced the course of weight gain. A similar effect was observed for other psychopathology measures, especially body image distortion. In general, higher weight at admission was associated with less weight gain. Higher weight at admission was also predicted by higher other psychopathology measures, but not AIDA scores. Conclusion: The course of weight gain during inpatient treatment was hampered in adolescent AN patients who have difficulties developing a stable identity. Unlike other aspects of psychopathology, this was independent of the initial weight. Thus, in addition to the level of underweight and other aspects of psychopathology, difficulties in identity development constitute a relevant aspect of illness severity in AN. This recommends consideration of identity development during treatment. Copyright © 2022 Budde, Wilms, Föcker, Dalhoff, Müller and Wessing."

The current study 1) compared disordered eating between sexual minority (SM) and gender minority (GM) adolescents; 2) examined how general psychological factors (self-esteem, depression, and stress) and SGM-specific factors (e.g., feelings about SGM identity, access to SGM resources) were associated with disordered eating; and 3) examined whether associations between these factors differed for SM versus GM adolescents. Method SGM adolescents in the U.S. (N = 8814; 35.0% GM; 43.7% cisgender girls; 66.9% White; M-age = 15.6) reported their disordered eating, depressive symptoms, stress, self-esteem, and SGM-related experiences on an anonymous, cross-sectional online survey. Results GM adolescents exhibited a higher prevalence of clinical threshold disordered eating than SM adolescents. Self-esteem was associated with lower odds of caloric restriction, purging, and binge eating. Depression was associated with higher odds of caloric restriction, diet pill use, purging, laxatives, and binge eating. Stress was associated with higher odds of purging. Associations were stronger for GM adolescents' caloric restriction. Positive feelings about SGM identity were associated with lower odds of caloric restriction, purging, and binge eating, whereas greater stress of coming out was associated with higher odds of caloric restriction, purging, and binge eating. Discussion These results suggest that SGM adolescents' disordered eating is associated with both general psychological factors and unique SGM experiences. Results highlight the importance of considering how the unique experiences of SGM youth may leave them vulnerable to disordered eating behaviors. Public Significance Statement Sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth are disproportionately affected by disordered eating. The current study found that higher depression and stress, and lower self-esteem, were associated with SGM adolescents' disordered eating. Furthermore, unique SGM experiences, such as stress about coming out, were also associated with eating pathology. Results highlight the importance of considering SGM adolescents' perceptions of their identity and social support."

Determinants of body image disturbance and disordered eating behaviors among self-identified lgbtq individuals. . https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-023-00810-2","Plain English SummarySexual minorities are individuals who are more likely to experience mental health illnesses due to their increased experiences of social stresses, such as stigma, discrimination, prejudice, and fear of rejection. Two of the common mental health illnesses lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer individuals develop are eating disorders and disturbed body image. Eating disorders and body image concerns are serious mental health illnesses with the likelihood of progressing into life-threatening conditions. Behavioral characteristics of eating disorders can be seen as binge eating episodes, extreme dieting, and inappropriate compensatory behaviors such as fasting, self-induced vomiting, excessive exercise, laxative or diuretic misuse, and or misuse of other weight loss/diet pills. Disordered eating patterns and body image concerns are multifactorial and complex, involving a wide range of psychological, sociocultural, and biological determinants. The current study is one of the few observational studies that tackle sexual minority health related issues, specifically investigate the presence and determinants of body image disturbances and disordered eating behaviors in gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer individuals compared to heterosexual and/or cis-gender population in Lebanon. The study findings suggest a potential higher risk of disorder eating behaviors and body image disturbances among sexual and gender minorities.It has been previously established that sexual minorities are more likely to suffer from mental health illnesses due to experiencing unique stressors such as fear, anxiety, stigma, harassment, and prejudice. Results revealed two noteworthy mental health disorders reported by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals, disordered eating behaviors and disturbed body image. Yet, a-priori studies revealed inconsistent results with regards to body image concerns and eating disorder symptoms and attitudes among sexual minorities. Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed at investigating the occurrence of disordered eating behaviors (DEB) and body image disturbance (BID) among sexual minorities in Lebanon. Additionally, the correlation between several determinants of DEB and BID including fear of negative evaluation, generalized anxiety, social support, and harassment levels have been examined. Generally, the present study revealed that LGBTQ population scored higher than cisgender and heterosexual individuals for the mean and global scores of the EDE-Q6.0 and BAS-2. Only generalized anxiety and fear of negative evaluation scales were significantly associated with DEB and BID among different sexual orientation and gender identity individuals. Therefore, it is very important that health professionals working with such vulnerable populations meticulously assess for disordered eating behaviors and body image disturbance for better communication and management."

Here, we compare treatment outcomes for cisgender boys and TGE youth with cisgender girls receiving family-based treatment for an eating disorder. Methods: Patients were aged 6-24 and either active in treatment or discharged from September 1, 2020, to November 1, 2022 (N = 1,235). Patient exposure to treatment varied given individualized length of treatment. Outcomes include eating disorder symptoms, depression, anxiety, suicidality, caregiver burden, and parental con fidence in supervising treatment. Treatment outcomes for cisgender boys and TGE youth were compared with cisgender girls. Results: Patients included n = 975 cisgender girls, n = 152 cisgender boys, and n = 108 TGE youth. Anorexia nervosa was the most common diagnosis. Cisgender boys reported signi ficantly lower eating disorder (b =-2.7 [-4.1,-1.3]), anxiety (b =-1.6 [-2.2,-0.9]), and depression (b =-1.7 [-2.4,-0.9]) symptoms at admission compared with cisgender girls. TGE patients had signi ficantly higher anxiety (b = 1.08 [0.28, 1.91]) and depression (b = 1.72 [0.78, 2.65]) symptoms compared with cisgender girls. Cisgender boys started with signi ficantly lower suicidal ideation (b =-1.28 [-2.19,-0.43]) and TGE patients with signi ficantly higher suicidal ideation (b = 1.63 [0.76, 2.51]) than cisgender girls. All symptoms improved during treatment and improved at similar rates over time in treatment regardless of gender identity. Discussion: Early evidence from this study supports the use of family-based treatment for cisgender boys and TGE youth with eating disorders. Further research is needed on the long-term outcomes of this approach for youth of all genders. (c) 2023 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The prevalence of DEBs is considerably and consistently higher in TNG youth compared to their cisgender peers. Nonetheless, there are no DEBs measures tailored to this population. Although the field of TNG DEBs research is quickly growing, gaps in knowledge remain, due, in part, to a lack of TNG input on research protocols focused on this population, and underrepresentation of TNG people in DEBs research. The goal of this research protocol is to develop and evaluate a community informed DEBs measure specific for TNG youth. We will implement youth-engaged research methods to create affirming, inclusive research protocols and optimize recruitment of subpopulations of TNG youth historically excluded from research (i.e., transfeminine youth of color and non-binary youth). A TNG youth advisory board of 5-7 members will participate in all research activities, including developing recruitment matrices, conducting qualitative analyses, developing survey items, interpreting results, and disseminating the scientific findings."

Emotional dysregulation and eating symptoms in gender dysphoria and eating disorders: the mediating role of body uneasiness. . https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-024-05663-9","Emotional dysregulation is a key transdiagnostic dimension of several clinical conditions, including eating disorders (EDs) and gender dysphoria (GD). Not only is there frequent comorbidity between EDs and GD, but GD individuals also commonly experience ED symptoms and body-image disturbances. However, more research is needed to understand how specific body-related experiences may differently interact with difficulties in emotion regulation and dysfunctional eating behaviors in EDs and GD. Thus, the present study aimed at exploring potential associations between emotional dysregulation and ED symptomatology in individuals diagnosed with anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), or gender dysphoria (GD), also considering the mediating role of specific dimensions of body uneasiness. A national sample of N = 96 help-seekers assigned female at birth (n = 32 with AN, n = 32 with BN, n = 32 with GD) was recruited from two specialized care centers. Participants completed the Eating Disorder Inventory-3 (EDI-3) and the Body Uneasiness Test (BUT), while the Shedler-Westen Assessment Procedure-200 (SWAP-200) was used to evaluate emotional dysregulation. Findings showed that several body uneasiness dimensions mediated the relationship between emotional dysregulation and ED symptoms, in both AN-BN and GD participants. In GD individuals, body avoidance emerged as a significant mediator of the relationship between emotional dysregulation and ED symptoms, whereas in both AN-BN patients and GD individuals, depersonalization toward the body emerged as a significant mediator. The results suggest that the interplay between emotional dysregulation, body uneasiness, and ED symptoms may be crucial for the development of comprehensive and tailored prevention strategies."

The aim of this study was to explore possible reasons, such as differences in eating and exercise behaviors. This was a prospective cross-sectional study of TGD adolescent patients at the pediatric endocrinology outpatient clinic of the Vienna General Hospital from January to July 2022. Patients were included in the World Health Organization's Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) survey, which assesses for multiple measures including exercise, eating, and mental wellbeing. We recruited 32 patients via the outpatient clinic, and a further 55 adolescents self-identified as TGD through the survey. Responses from the cohort of 87 TGD adolescents were compared to the Austrian sample containing 10,110 participants. TGD adolescents reported significantly lower levels of physical activity than the national sample, both in instances of vigorous activity (p = 0.002) and any physical activity lasting > 60 min (p < 0.001) per week. Gender variance was here demonstrated to be a strong predictor for physical inactivity levels, even when correcting for low mental health scores. Regarding body image, TGD participants were also more likely to describe themselves as feeling too fat (p = 0.001). No statistically significant difference in eating behavior was found. Conclusion: The results of this study point towards the complexity of healthcare needs in the TGD adolescent population. The interconnectedness of mental health and exercise behavior is well described. However, qualitative work is needed to understand the specific relationship between gender expression, body image, eating and exercise behaviors, as well as social inclusion."

(2022). “can you see me?” videoconferencing and eating disorder risk during <scp>covid</scp>‐19: anxiety, impairment, and mediators. . https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23844","Objective The use of videoconferencing has increased during the pandemic, creating prolonged exposure to self-image. This research aimed to investigate whether eating disorder (ED) risk was associated with videoconferencing performance for work or study and to explore whether the use of safety behaviors and self-focused attention mediated the relationship between ED risk and perceived control over performance anxiety, impaired engagement, or avoidance of videoconferencing for work or study. Method In 2020, an online survey was distributed within Australia to those aged over 18 years via academic and social networks, measuring: use of videoconferencing for work/study, demographics, ED risk, safety behaviors for appearance concerns, self-focused attention, perceived control over performance anxiety, perceived engagement impairment, and avoidance of videoconferencing. A total of 640 participants (77.3% female, M-age = 26.2 years) returned complete data and were included in analyses. Results 245 participants (38.7%) were considered at-risk for EDs (SCOFF > 2). Those at-risk reported significantly more safety behaviors, self-focused attention, impaired engagement, and avoidance, plus lower perceived control over performance anxiety than those not at-risk. Multiple mediation models found the effects of ED risk on control over performance anxiety, impaired engagement, and avoidance were partially mediated by safety behaviors and self-focused attention. Discussion Our cross-sectional findings suggest videoconferencing for work/study-related purposes is associated with performance anxiety, impaired engagement, and avoidance among individuals at-risk for EDs. Poorer videoconferencing outcomes appear more strongly related to social anxiety variables than ED status. Clinicians and educators may need to provide extra support for those using videoconferencing. Public Significance Because videoconferencing often involves seeing your own image (via self-view) we wondered whether the appearance concerns experienced by those with eating disorders (EDs) might interfere with the ability to focus on or to contribute to work/study videoconferencing meetings. We found that although those with EDs experience more impairments in their videoconferencing engagement/contribution, these were linked just as strongly to social anxiety as they were to appearance concerns."

Method Participants included a large national sample of U.S. college students (N = 286,720) who completed the repeated cross-sectional Healthy Minds Study from 2013 to 2020. Descriptive statistics and polynomial regressions quantified time-trends in participants' ED symptoms and past 12-month mental healthcare. Moderated regressions examined temporal changes in ED symptoms and mental healthcare based on sociodemographic characteristics. Results Individuals' engagement in different cognitive and behavioral ED symptoms, and likelihoods of exhibiting current probable EDs, reporting lifetime ED diagnoses, and (for individuals with current probable EDs) receiving therapy or counseling in the past 12-months exhibited nonlinear increases from 2013 to 2020. Further, the prevalence of current and lifetime ED symptoms and (for symptomatic individuals) past 12-month mental healthcare differed over time for individuals with different BMIs and gender, sexual, and racial/ethnic identities (but not ages). In particular, individuals with higher BMIs and those who identified as male, bisexual, and gay, lesbian, or queer exhibited increasing ED pathology over time. Discussion These findings provide important information on groups of U.S. college students that have experienced increasing burden of ED symptoms and may help guide ED prevention, treatment, and research priorities. Public Significance Recent temporal changes in the prevalence of eating disorder (ED) symptoms and mental healthcare were examined in a national sample of U.S. young adults. Non-linear increases in ED symptoms and mental healthcare were identified among U.S. young adults overall from 2013 to 2020.

This study tested whether items on the SCOFF performed differently as a function of FI. As many people with FI hold multiple marginalized identities, this study also tested if the SCOFF performs differently as a function of food-security status in individuals with different gender identities and different perceived weight statuses. Data were from the 2020/2021 Healthy Minds Study (N = 122,269). Past-year FI was established using the two-item Hunger Vital Sign. Differential item functioning (DIF) assessed whether SCOFF items performed differently (i.e., had different probabilities of endorsement) in groups of individuals with FI versus those without. Both uniform DIF (constant between-group difference in item -endorsement probability across ED pathology) and non-uniform DIF (variable between-group difference in item -endorsement probability across ED pathology) were examined. Several SCOFF items demonstrated both statis-tically significant uniform and non-uniform DIF (ps < .001), but no instances of DIF reached practical signifi-cance (as indicated by effect sizes pseudo Delta R2 >= 0.035; all pseudo Delta R2's <= 0.006). When stratifying by gender identity and weight status, although most items demonstrated statistically significant DIF, only the SCOFF item measuring body-size perception showed practically significant non-uniform DIF for perceived weight status. Findings suggest the SCOFF is an appropriate screening measure for ED pathology among college students with FI and provide preliminary support for using the SCOFF in individuals with FI and certain marginalized identities."

However, little is known about how sexual minority stress related to bisexual orientation is associated with emotional eating and body esteem. The current study examined the associations between bisexual-specific minority stress and emotional eating and body esteem in a sample of bisexual plus (bi+) adults (including bisexual, pansexual, queer, and those with attractions to more than one gender regardless of identity), and tested the moderating effects of identity centrality, affirmation, and community connectedness as potential protective factors. This study leveraged data from an online survey of 498 adults (77.46% cisgender women; 79.7% White), ages 18 to 64 years (M = 28.5; SD = 9.59). Bisexual-specific minority stress was associated with more emotional eating (8 = 0.15, p = .013) and lower body esteem (8 = -0.16, p = .005), while controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, body mass index, and heterosexist minority stress. This finding remained the same when sensitivity analyses were conducted with participants who identified specifically as bisexual. Identity centrality and affirmation and community connectedness did not demonstrate moderating effects but they had main effects, such that they were positively associated with body esteem (8 = 0.16, p = .001; 8 = 0.21, p < .001; 8 = 0.13, p = .004, respectively). Results suggest that anti-bisexual minority stress has a unique association with bi+ individuals' emotional eating and body esteem, and identified potential individual- and community-level protective factors for body esteem.

A comprehensive model of embodiment in late pubertal female-at-birth adolescents: the role of body awareness and mental health. . https://doi.org/10.3390/adolescents5020014","Body awareness consists of aesthetic body image, functional body image, and interoception. Previous studies indicated a link between these components of body awareness and mental health. This study aims to clarify the relationship among these variables during the period of pubertal body changes. As puberty progresses, individuals' perceptions of their bodies shift, which has been associated with a decline in mental health, according to the existing literature. To investigate this issue, a sample of 294 post-pubertal adolescents assigned female at birth completed assessments related to body awareness, mental health, psychosomatic symptoms, gender congruence, and eating disorders. A network analysis was conducted to illustrate the intricate interactions among the observed variables, and a mediation model was utilised to explore how body image influences overall health, with interoception and functional body image acting as mediators. The study identifies three key variables-body image, mental health, and interoception-as central within the network. Additionally, functional body image was significantly associated with other variables in the study. Ultimately, both direct and indirect effects of body image on mental health were found, mediated through interoception and functional body image. The clinical implications emphasise the importance of enhancing awareness of bodily sensations and functions to support psychological well-being, particularly during a developmental stage characterised by challenges related to body image due to rapid changes in puberty."

We used multilevel regression models to examine the interactive effects of gender identity and perceptions of school safety on the 4 different outcome variables (physical activity, physical education, healthy and unhealthy eating habits). All models included student- and school-level characteristics as controls.Results: Findings indicated that transgender students, when compared to non-transgender students, reported (a) feeling less safe at school; (b) more physical activity, but less participation in physical education at school; and (c) both more healthy as well as unhealthy eating behaviors. Adjusted regression models showed a significant interaction between gender identity and perceived school safety on healthy eating behaviors; simple slopes indicated that transgender students have healthier eating behaviors when the school context is perceived as safe compared to those who perceived the school as less safe.Conclusions: School interventions are needed to improve school safety for transgender youth and to reduce gender identity-related disparities in healthy eating and physical activity.

The primary objective of this study was to describe the medical, anthropometric, and psychiatric characteristics of gender diverse adolescents hospitalized for eating disorders and compare these characteristics to cisgender peers hospitalized for eating disorders. The secondary objective was to evaluate percent median body mass index as one marker of malnutrition and treatment goal body mass index as a recovery metric between patients' birth-assigned sex and affirmed gender using standardized clinical growth charts. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted of 463 patients admitted to an inpatient eating disorders medical unit between 2012 and 2020. To compare medical, anthropometric, and psychiatric data between gender diverse and cisgender patients, chi-square/Fisher's exact and t-tests were used. Clinical growth charts matching the patients' birth-assigned sex and affirmed gender identity were used to assess percent of median body mass index and treatment goal body mass index. Results: Ten patients (2.2%) identified as gender diverse and were younger than cisgender patients [13.6 (1.5) years vs. 15.6 (2.7) years, p = 0.017]. Gender diverse patients were hospitalized with a higher percent median body mass index compared to cisgender peers [97.1% (14.8) vs. 87.9% (13.7), p = 0.037], yet demonstrated equally severe vital sign instability such as bradycardia [44 (8.8) beats per minute vs. 46 (10.6) beats per minute, p = 0.501], systolic hypotension [84 (7.1) mmHg vs. 84 (9.7) mmHg, p = 0.995], and diastolic hypotension [46 (5.8) mmHg vs. 45 (7.3) mmHg, p = 0.884]. Gender diverse patients had a higher prevalence of reported anxiety symptoms compared to cisgender patients (60% vs. 28%, p = 0.037). Conclusions: Gender diverse patients demonstrated complications of malnutrition including vital sign instability despite presenting with a higher weight. This is consistent with a greater proportion of gender diverse patients diagnosed with atypical anorexia nervosa compared to cisgender peers. Additionally, psychiatric comorbidities were present among both groups, with a larger percentage of gender diverse patients endorsing anxiety compared to cisgender patients."

A validated and anonymous online questionnaire was completed by 204 participants (52.5% men, 43.1% gay, mean age 29.34 + 6.77 years) across Canada, who were consuming DS at the time of the study. Analyses included descriptive statistics to characterize the sample based on gender, sexuality, age, ethnicity, and other demographic attributes, using Pearson's chi-square tests and multi-way cross-tabulation analyses. Additionally, regression analyses, including binary and logistic regressions, were employed to identify predictors of DS use. Data analysis concluded that vitamins/minerals (92.2%), proteins (84.3%) and carbohydrates (75.5%) were the most consumed types of supplements. Identifying as certain genders and sexualities was significantly associated with supplement preferences, such that men reported higher use of amino acids (p = 0.033) and non-vitamins/mineral antioxidants compared to individuals identifying as other genders (p = 0.006). Moreover, bisexual participants consumed amino acids (p = 0.043) and carbohydrates (p = 0.026) more frequently when compared to non-bisexual participants. The most listed reason for DS use was to improve immunity (60.3%), with health care professionals being listed as the source of information by most participants (51.0%).

Using causal inference methods, we measured longitudinal associations between incarceration and post-release substance use among Black men who have sex with men (BMSM), populations facing disproportionate risk of incarceration and substance use.Methods: Using data from the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN 061) study (N = 1553) we estimated associations between past 6-month incarceration and binge drinking, marijuana use, and stimulant use post release (at 12-month follow-up visit). Adjusted models used inverse probability weighting (IPW) to control for baseline (pre-incarceration) substance use and additional risk factors.Results: There were 1133 participants present at the twelve-month follow-up visit. Participants were predominately non-Hispanic Blacks and unemployed. At baseline, 60.1 % reported a lifetime history of incarceration, 22.9 % were HIV positive and 13.7 % had a history of an STI infection. A total of 43 % reported a history of depression. In adjusted analyses with IPW, recent incarceration was associated with crack-cocaine (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.53, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.03, 2.23) and methamphetamine use (AOR: 1.52, 95 % CI: 0.94-2.45). Controlling for pre-incarceration binge drinking, incarceration was associated with post-release binge drinking (AOR: 1.47, 95 % CI: 1.05, 2.04); in fully adjusted models the AOR was 1.14 (95 % CI: 0.81, 1.62). Incarceration was not associated with marijuana use.Conclusion: Findings underscore the need to provide substance use treatment in custody and post-release, and to consider alternatives to incarceration for substance using populations."

Defensive functioning of individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria at the beginning of their hormonal treatment. . https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.665547","Defense mechanisms are relevant indicators of psychological functioning and vulnerability to psychopathology. Their evaluation can unveil individuals' unconscious strategies for mediating reactions to emotional conflict and external stressors. At the beginning of their journey toward gender reassignment, individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria (GD) may experience conflict and stressful experiences that trigger a wide range of defense mechanisms. Mature defenses may strengthen these individuals as they travel along this important path, while neurotic and immature defenses may exacerbate their body dissatisfaction (BD) and hinder their processing of change. Only a few studies have investigated self-reported defensive functioning in transgender people, finding a higher frequency of maladaptive defense mechanisms relative to controls. The present study was the first to apply an in-depth clinician-rated tool to assess the entire hierarchy of defense mechanisms within a sample of transgender people. Defensive functioning and personality organization were assessed in 36 individuals diagnosed with GD (14 trans women, 22 trans men, mean age 23.47 years), using the Defense Mechanisms Rating Scales (Perry, 1990) and the Shedler-Westen Assessment Procedure-200 (Shedler et al., 2014). Body uneasiness was assessed using the Body Uneasiness Test (BUT; Cuzzolaro et al., 2006). The findings showed that defensive functioning correlated positively with healthy personality functioning and negatively with BD. Compared to cisgender controls, participants with GD who presented greater defensive functioning were found to be more immature and to demonstrate significant differences in many levels of functioning. The clinical implications of the results suggest that psychological interventions aimed at improving defensive functioning in individuals with GD will be important in helping them manage the challenges posed by their gender transition."

However, the existing line of research on this topic remains limited. This study explores the complex relationship in transgender individuals between body objectification, body weight dissatisfaction, and eating concerns. A sample of 154 individuals (77 transgenders paired with 77 cisgenders) was recruited via LGBTQ+ groups' mailing lists. Participants completed various questionnaires assessing body image, eating psychopathology, depression, and body objectification. Propensity score matching was performed with different variables: age, current BMI, years of education, current self-identified gender, and sexual orientation. The results revealed that transgender individuals experienced higher levels of body objectification, body weight dissatisfaction, and eating concerns compared to their cisgender counterparts. Additionally, age emerged as a protective factor, as older transgender individuals demonstrated improved body acceptance and self-esteem. Logistic regression analyzes indicated that bulimic behaviors, depressive symptoms, and appearance control beliefs were specific factors significantly associated with being transgender. Our findings highlight the unique challenges faced by transgender individuals in navigating their gender identity and body image, underscoring the importance of targeted interventions and support systems."

Disparities in mental health symptoms among sexual and gender diverse subgroups in a national sample of college students.. . https://doi.org/10.1037/sgd0000714","Mental health disparities experienced by sexual and gender diverse (SGD) young adults are well documented. Yet, few studies have examined mental health disparities between SGD subgroups. Even fewer have investigated disparities that may exist for individuals whose SGD identities are nonmonosexual (i.e., diverse sexual orientations besides gay/lesbian) or gender nonbinary, who may experience exacerbated marginalization and disparities. The present study examines differences in weight and shape concerns and symptoms of depression, anxiety (general, panic, social, and posttraumatic stress), alcohol use disorder, and insomnia among sexually diverse (SD) subgroups (lesbian or gay, bisexual, queer, asexual, pansexual, multiple identities, and questioning), and gender diverse (GD) subgroups (trans man, trans woman, and nonbinary) of college students. We hypothesized that nonmonosexual students would have a greater mental health symptom burden than their monosexual peers and we explored additional subgroup differences among SD and GD subgroups separately. Kruskal-Wallis tests with Mann-Whitney U post hoc tests were conducted to examine associations between mental health symptoms and sexual orientation and gender identity separately. Results show high mental health symptom levels among most subgroups. Some nonmonosexual SD subgroups were at particularly high risk; namely, pansexual students. Questioning and asexual SD subgroups had similar and lower symptom levels than their monosexual peers, respectively. SD subgroup disparities varied by mental health symptom type. No significant differences by GD subgroups were found. Clinicians and institutions should consider these disparities and future research should aim to better understand them."
