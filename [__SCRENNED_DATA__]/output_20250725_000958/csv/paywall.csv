Very few interventions have been developed, adapted for, or evaluated in these fundamentally different delivery contexts. Transdiagnostic treatments may be ideal for addressing the comorbidity, complexity, and heterogeneity typical of acute mental health settings. Our aim was to examine initial acceptability and effectiveness of an adaptation of the Unified Protocols for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Children and Adolescents (UP-C/A; Ehrenreich-May, Kennedy, et al., 2017), delivered as part of comprehensive therapeutic programming in a general psychiatric PHP. We recruited 152 youths (M age = 13.1 years, 62.5% female) and caregivers, who participated in an average of 11 days of intensive UP-C/A intervention. Participants rated symptoms and functioning at baseline, weekly, posttreatment, and 1-month follow-up. Latent growth curve modeling was used to examine patterns of change and evaluate the impact of potential demographic and treatment-related covariates. For all outcomes, a quadratic model best fit the data, with symptoms and emotional reactivity decreasing significantly during treatment and then leveling off during follow-up. There was a medium-sized change in functional impairment from baseline to the 1-month follow-up, and ≥90% of participants reported treatment as acceptable and helpful. Results provide initial support for use of a transdiagnostic, cognitive-behavioral intervention in acute mental health settings and suggest important future directions, including controlled trials and investigation of implementation supports. © 2024 Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies"

We held three focus groups lasting 60 minutes each, recruiting participants via purposive snowball sampling (n = 15), with additional opportunities to respond to focus group prompts asynchronously. Eligible participants were individuals with lived experience of an ED, self-identified as being in recovery, had three or more tattoos, and spoke English. Participants predominantly held gender-expansive (n = 4 Non-Binary, n = 3 Genderqueer, n = 3 Cisgender Women, n = 3 Transgender, n = 2 Transmasculine, n = 2 Gender Non-Conforming, n = 2 Intersex, n = 1 Cisgender Man) and non-heterosexual identities. Focus groups were held between April 2021 and July 2023 and followed a semi-structured interview format. Primary analyses focused on participants’ responses to open-ended prompts regarding how they understood the relationships between tattooing, body image, and ED recovery. Thematic analysis identified four core themes: Tattooing allowing for embodiment, tattooing allowing for recovery-oriented behaviors, tattooing enabling positive body image, and tattooing facilitating empowerment. An overarching message was that tattooing is a therapeutic and transformative process, allowing for self-determination. Participants indicated that tattooing can be experienced as a powerful mechanism for behavioral change and shifts in relationship to one’s body. Participants expressed that tattooing can be an effective route towards both gender euphoria and body liberation, enhancing one’s ability to maintain ED recovery. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Methods: A pragmatic, real-world evaluation was conducted on the Youth Brief Intervention Service between June 2021 (inception) and October 2022. Service users were offered four sessions over an approximate one-month period. Sessions focused on distress tolerance, safety plans and support systems. Implementation outcomes related to service uptake, retention, fidelity of the model and service user experience. Effectiveness outcomes were measured pre-post and included mental health-related hospital service utilization (primary outcome), functioning, mental health status, self-harm, suicidal ideation and quality of life. Results: Of the 136 young people referred to the Youth Brief Intervention Service, 99 were accepted with 17 disengaging before the first session. Eighty percent of people who commenced, completed the package of care. Young persons' and parent/carers experience of service was high (97% and 88%, respectively). Mental health-related emergency department presentations and inpatient days decreased from 3 months pre-intake to 3 months post-intake (42 vs. 7 presentations, X2 = 25.3, p <.001; 11 vs. 0 inpatient days, X2 = 9.1, p =.01). There were significant improvements in mental health status, days engaging in self-harm, general health and functioning and quality of life. Conclusions: The Youth Brief Intervention Service is feasible, acceptable, subjectively beneficial and coincided with less mental health-related emergency department presentations and inpatient days, and improved mental health status and behaviour. © 2024 The Authors.

The effects of family support and smartphone-derived homestay on daily mood and depression among sexual and gender minority adolescents.. . https://doi.org/10.1037/abn0000917","Sexual and gender minority (SGM) adolescents are at elevated risk for depression. This risk is especially pronounced among adolescents whose home environment is unsupportive or nonaffirming, as these adolescents may face familial rejection due to their identity. Therefore, it is critical to better understand the mechanisms underlying this risk by probing temporally sensitive associations between negative mood and time spent in potentially hostile home environments. The current study included adolescents (N = 141; 43% SGM; 13–18 years old), oversampled for depression history, who completed clinical interviews assessing lifetime psychiatric history and depression severity as well as self-report measures of social support. Participants also installed an app on their personal smartphones, which assessed their daily mood and geolocation-determined mobility patterns over a 6-month followup period. Over the 6-month follow-up period, SGM adolescents reported elevated depression severity and lower daily mood relative to non-SGM youth. Interestingly, SGM adolescents who reported low family support experienced lower daily mood than non-SGM adolescents, particularly on days when they spent more time at home. Current findings reinforce evidence for disparities in depression severity among SGM adolescents and highlight family support as a key factor. Specifically, more time spent in home environments with low family support was associated with worse mood among SGM adolescents. These results underscore the need for clinical interventions to support SGM youth, particularly interventions that focus on familial relationships and social support within the home environment. © 2024 American Psychological Association"

This study examined whether LGBTQ+ status moderated the relation between negative healthcare experiences and DEBs in undergraduates. Undergraduates (n = 322) from a Southeastern (United States) university completed measures of healthcare discrimination, trust in physicians, and DEBs. Analyses investigated whether LGBTQ+ status moderated the relation between healthcare discrimination and DEBs; trust in physicians and DEBs.

Despite evidence from cisgender samples linking sexual assault exposure to body image concerns and disordered eating behaviors, such as weight and shape control behaviors (WSCBs), little is known about these relationships in TNB people. The purpose of this study was to assess associations among past-year sexual assault exposure, body areas satisfaction, body weight esteem, and high-risk WSCBs in a sample of TNB young adults. Methods: A sample of 714 participants completed a cross-sectional online survey. Multivariable linear and logistic models were fit to determine associations between constructs of interest. Natural effects mediation analyses assessed for potential mediation of the relationship between sexual assault and WSCBs by body areas satisfaction and body weight esteem. Analyses were stratified by three gender identity categories. Results: Past-year sexual assault exposure was associated with significantly decreased body areas satisfaction, but only for nonbinary participants. No significant association was found between sexual assault and body weight esteem. Sexual assault was associated with significantly increased risk for WSCBs across gender identity categories. No mediation of these relationships by body areas satisfaction and body weight esteem was observed. Conclusion: Findings support clinical consideration of WSCBs in TNB survivors of sexual assault. Results suggest that multiple factors, including body image and sexual assault, may contribute separately to disordered eating behaviors in TNB young adults. ª Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

Gender-diverse individuals from non-Western cultural contexts (e.g., China) are at potentially high risk for WBI. Yet, no research has examined WBI and associated negative health consequences in this historically underrepresented population. Method: A cross-sectional, online survey sampled Chinese gender-diverse individuals (N = 410, Mage = 22.33 years). Variables were self-reported, including demographics, WBI, body shame, body dissatisfaction, disordered eating, physical and mental health status, and gender minority stress (e.g., internalized cisgenderism). Analyses included correlations and multiple hierarchical regressions. Results: Pearson bivariate correlations demonstrated associations between higher WBI and more eating and body image disturbances and poor physical and mental health. After adjusting for age, BMI, gender identity, and gender minority stress, higher WBI was uniquely and positively associated with higher body shame, higher body dissatisfaction, higher disordered eating, and poor physical and mental health. Notably, WBI accounted for more unique variance in eating and body image disturbances (13%–25% explained by WBI) than physical and mental health (1%–4% explained by WBI). Discussion: While replication with longitudinal and experimental designs is needed to speak to the temporal dynamics and causality, our findings identify WBI as a unique, meaningful correlate of eating and body image disturbances in Chinese gender-diverse adults. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

However, little is known about daily SMS-DEB associations. We conducted a 14-day daily diary study of 321 U.S.-based sexual minority cisgender women ages 19–35 who were in a relationship with a woman. SMS were assessed using an 8-item daily measure of distal SMS (e.g. heard anti-LGBT talk, verbal harassment), and DEB with single items capturing dietary restraint, overeating, loss of control eating, and emotional eating. Multi-level models revealed on days when women experienced SMS, they were more likely to report dietary restraint and emotional eating, but not overeating or loss of control eating. Women who generally reported more frequent SMS were more likely to report all four DEB. There were no significant couple-level SMS-DEB associations. These findings expand our understanding of how SMS is associated with DEB in the daily lives of cisgender sexual minority women.

Development and preliminary validation of the comprehensive emotional eating scale (cees). . https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2025.107969","In emotional eating (EE), affective states influence desire to eat and/or eating behavior. Most research on EE focuses on over-/under-eating in response to negative emotions, the former of which is related to higher weight and binge-spectrum eating disorder (ED) symptoms while the latter has been implicated in low weight and restrictive-only ED. Individuals endorsing both forms of negative EE are more impaired than those reporting unidirectional negative EE. Less is known about the influence of positive emotions on eating, in part due to a lack of self-report measures of positive over- and under-eating as separate constructs. The current study presents the development, including item reduction and initial factorial validity (primary aims) and convergent validity (secondary aims) of the Comprehensive Emotional Eating Scale (CEES), a four-factor measure of positive and negative over- and under-eating. The initial 134-item pool for the CEES was based on a review of extant emotional eating scales and emotion words from the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. The item pool was reduced and four factors identified using exploratory graphical analysis. The structure of the final set of 40 items was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. Convergent validity of the negative over- and under-eating scales was established using measures of body image-focused eating disorder and ARFID symptoms, and exploratory data on the correlates of positive over- and under eating were reported. The CEES showed preliminary evidence of factorial and convergent validity in a US-based convenience sample. It allows for classification on all four quadrants of emotional eating. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd"

Method: We used 21 disorder categories provided by the diagnostic and statistical manual (DSM) to characterize diagnoses among primary care (PC) patients. For each patient, we generated counts of unique disorder categories present during the PC encounter or in the year prior. We used these counts to generate multiple indexes, which we compared in a 60% training sample of our population. Using model fit statistics generated from ordered multinomial logistic regressions, we identified the subset of DSM categories which, structured as index, were most predictive of MHSUD hospitalization and death. We validated and fine-tuned the form of the selected index in the full population using measures of calibration and discrimination. Results: In model development, the index (I-6) which best fit the data (R2 = 0.191) included the following six disorder categories: substance use, depressive, psychotic, bipolar, trauma, and personality. When applied in the full population and weighted by disorder severity, this index demonstrated good predictive discrimination for MHSUD death (C = 0.66) and hospitalization (C = 0.88) and was well calibrated in comparisons of observed versus predicted outcomes. Conclusions: We recommend the I-6 as a parsimonious and effective tool for MHSUD burden risk adjustment. © 2023"

Randomized control trials have demonstrated “rapid and robust antidepressant effects” of generic ketamine in individuals with treatment-resistant depression and bipolar depression. This paper assesses the medical safety of ketamine as a treatment for co-occurring treatment-resistant depression or bipolar depression in patients in higher levels of care for their eating disorders. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 104 patients receiving higher levels of care for their eating disorder and who had co-occurring treatment-resistant depression or bipolar disorder. Data on medical safety, particularly in the context of medical and nutritional instability, was collected and analyzed. The findings demonstrated that ketamine is a safe intervention for patients with eating disorders and co-occurring treatment-resistant depression or bipolar depression, even in cases where relative medical or nutritional instability was present due to disordered eating behaviors. This paper presents that ketamine can be used safely with medical monitoring in patents with co-occurring eating disorder and treatment-resistant depression or bipolar depression, despite the challenges posed by medical and nutritional instability in this patient population. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd"

Sexual minority status and food and alcohol disturbance among college students: the moderating role of body esteem. . https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2023.101745","Food and alcohol disturbance (FAD; restricting caloric intake before, during, or after drinking to either offset calories or to increase intoxication) is common among college students and poses a threat to students' health. In conjunction, sexual minority (SM; i.e., not exclusively heterosexual) college students may be at increased risk of engaging in alcohol misuse and disordered eating compared to their heterosexual peers due to exposure to minority stress. However, little research has examined whether engagement in FAD differs by SM status. Body esteem (BE) is an important resilience factor among SMs that may influence SM students' risk of participating in FAD. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to understand the association between SM status and FAD with additional interest in BE as a moderating factor. Participants were 459 college students who engaged in past 30-day binge drinking. Most participants identified as White (66.7 %), female (78.4 %), heterosexual (69.3 %), with a mean age of 19.60 (SD = 1.54) years. Participants completed two surveys (3 weeks apart) over the course of an academic semester. Analyses revealed a significant interaction between SM status and BE, such that SMs with lower BE (T1) reported more engagement in FAD-intoxication (T2), whereas SMs with higher BE (T1) reported less engagement in FAD-calories (T2) and FAD-intoxication (T2) than their heterosexual peers. Stressors associated with body esteem may contribute to increased FAD engagement among SM students. Consequently, BE may be an especially important target for interventions aimed at reducing FAD among SM college students. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

Mental health after the covid-19 pandemic among finnish youth: a repeated, cross-sectional, population-based study. . https://doi.org/10.1016/s2215-0366(24)00108-1","Background: High levels of mental health problems among young people were reported during the COVID-19 pandemic, but studies of the post-pandemic period are scarce. We assessed mental health problems among Finnish youth before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic using nationwide population-based samples. Our aim was to examine in which direction the heightened levels of adolescent mental health problems have developed after the pandemic. Methods: In this national, repeated cross-sectional, population-based study in Finland, we recruited students at lower and upper secondary level (aged 13–20 years) who were taking part in the Finnish School Health Promotion (SHP) survey in 2015–23 (119 681–158 897 participants per round). The SHP is based on total sampling and conducted biennially between March and May. Self-reports covered the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale; the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire for depression; the Mini Social Phobia Inventory for social anxiety; the Short Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale for mental wellbeing; loneliness; the Sick, Control, One Stone, Fat, Food measure for disordered eating; and suicidality (suicidal ideation, deliberate self-harm, and suicide attempts). Scales were dichotomised using validated cutoffs. Presence of any and comorbid mental health problems was assessed. Logistic (for dichotomised outcomes) and linear (for Short Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale) mixed effects models were used to analyse the effect of survey year on mental health, controlling for sociodemographic background factors and stratified by gender and school level. Cisgender and transgender youth were compared. Findings: Between 2015 and 2023, the SHP study recruited 722 488 students (371 634 [51·6%] girls and 348 857 [48·4%] boys) with a mean age of 15·8 years (SD 1·3) who were either in the eighth and ninth grades of comprehensive school or the first and second years of general and vocational upper secondary schools in Finland. The proportion of participants with generalised anxiety, depression, and social anxiety symptoms above the cutoff increased from pre-COVID-19 levels to 2021 and remained at these higher levels in 2023 among all study groups. Among girls in lower secondary education, prevalence of generalised anxiety, depression, and social anxiety symptoms increased from 2021 to 2023, as did social anxiety among girls in upper secondary education. Among boys, the proportion with social anxiety symptoms decreased between 2021 and 2023. Mental wellbeing scores decreased in all groups between 2021 and 2023, and disordered eating increased in girls, and in boys in lower secondary education. Suicidality increased in girls but not in boys. Loneliness was the only measure to show improvement in all groups from 2021 to 2023. In 2023, 55 895 (72·6%) of 76 994 girls and 22 718 (32·8%) of 69 205 boys reported at least one mental health problem, and 37 250 (48·4%) girls and 9442 (13·6%) boys reported comorbid mental health problems. Among both transfeminine and transmasculine youth, the prevalence of generalised anxiety and depression symptoms decreased from 2021 to 2023, but compared with cisgender youth, the proportions were significantly higher throughout. Interpretation: The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth mental health could be long lasting. In this study, the substantial change for the better among transgender youth was a positive exception. Providing adequate support and treatment for young people with poor mental health is essential, but solutions to the mental health crisis need to address a wider societal perspective and should be developed in partnership with young people.

Study Design: A retrospective database review. Setting: An equal-access, integrated health care system. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of Kaiser Permanente Northern California patients who underwent FFS from 2016 to 2021 on utilization of mental health services in a large integrated health care system. Full FFS was defined as all 3 facial thirds. We compared average quarterly utilization for 12 to 24 months before FFS with quarterly utilization during 12 to 24 months of follow-up. Patients who did not have continuous coverage for at least 12 months before and 12 months after FFS were excluded. Results: A total of 699 FFS cases were performed between 2016 and 2021, of which 478 cases were included (35.6 ± 12.3 years old, 207 [43.3%] had full FFS). Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests comparing pre-FFS and post-FFS utilization counts showed statistically significant reductions in the number of mental health-associated visits. Age and comorbid mental health diagnoses were significant predictors of mental health resource utilization in the pre-FFS period. A comorbid mood or anxiety disorder was a predictor of changes in resource utilization following FFS. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this endeavor is the first utilization study of FFS conducted in the United States. FFS was associated with significantly lower utilization of mental health services in the 12-month post-FFS period compared to the 12-month pre-FFS period. © 2025 American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation."

Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of patients who initiated estradiol at an adolescent gender clinic between 2010 and 2019. Data on the route of estradiol administration and antiandrogen use (spironolactone or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist) were collected, and laboratory data were analyzed. Scatterplots were used to visualize the relationship between the estradiol dose and testosterone and estradiol laboratory values. Results: A total of 118 patients were included, with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 17.2 (1.6) years. The most common route of estradiol administration was oral only (62.7%), followed by transdermal only (23.7%), multiple routes excluding subcutaneous (8.5%), and any subcutaneous (5.1%). Notable variability was observed in the serum estradiol levels, with means (SDs) of 131.9 (120.4) pg/mL for those on oral estrogen 6 to 8 mg per day, 62.6 (40.3) pg/mL for those on transdermal estrogen 0.1 to 0.15 mg every 24 hours, and 53.6 (42.4) pg/mL for those on subcutaneous estradiol. In patients who received spironolactone, transdermal estradiol was associated with lower testosterone levels than estradiol administered orally or subcutaneously. Conclusion: Oral, transdermal, and subcutaneous administrations of estrogen all lead to increased serum estradiol levels and are effective for use in gender-affirming care for youth. Patients on transdermal estrogen tended to have lower serum estradiol levels but also had more suppression of serum testosterone levels. © 2023 AACE"

Methods: In this observational study, adolescents with epilepsy seen in a single center between 2013 and 2022 who had comorbid EDs were compared to two control groups of adolescents with only epilepsy and only EDs. Patients with intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorder were excluded. Data retrieved included demographic and anthropometric details and clinical variables relating to seizure types, EDs, and psychiatric disorders and behaviors. Results: A total of 376 subjects were included in the study: 84 adolescents with both epilepsy and eating disorders, 135 with only epilepsy, and 157 with only EDs. The rate of EDs in adolescents with epilepsy was 7.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.6%–8.5%) overall, 11.3% (95% CI 8.8%–14.3%) in females, and 3.1% (95% CI 1.9%–4.8%) in males. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) time difference between the onset of epilepsy to an ED was 1.6 (.5–3.6) years. Among adolescents with epilepsy, those with an ED were more likely to be female (p =.001) and have a lower body mass index z-score (zBMI) percentile (p <.001). Epilepsy type, seizure frequency, or seizure duration were not specific for having or not having EDs. Among adolescents with EDs, those with epilepsy had a younger onset of their EDs (p <.001), included relatively more males (p =.007), and consisted of more cases of anorexia-nervosa-restrictive type (p <.001), and fewer cases of bulimia nervosa (p =.04) and binge eating disorder (p =.003). Adolescents with epilepsy and a comorbid ED were more likely to have psychiatric comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, and suicidality than adolescents with only epilepsy or EDs. Significance: EDs should be suspected and screened for in intellectually intact female and male adolescents with epilepsy, irrespective of their epilepsy type. If disturbed eating behaviors or EDs are identified, further evaluation should be directed at detecting other psychopathologies, including suicidality. © 2023 International League Against Epilepsy."

Background: Comprehensive analyses of psychosocial outcomes after gender-affirming FFS are absent in the literature resulting in a paucity of information on the impact of FFS on quality of life as well as ramifications in health insurance coverage of FFS. Methods: Scores from 11 validated, quantitative instruments from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) assessing anxiety, anger, depression, global mental health, global physical health, satisfaction with sex life, positive affect, emotional support, social isolation, companionship, and meaning and purpose. Patients within the preoperative group (pre-FFS) were evaluated >30 days before surgery and patients within the postoperative group (post-FFS) were evaluated ≥10 weeks after surgery. Results: A total of 169 patients [mean (SD) age, 33.5 (10.8) years] were included. Compared with the pre-FFS group (n=107), the post-FFS group (n=62) reported improved scores anxiety (56.8±8.8 vs 60.1±7.9, P=0.01), anger (47.4±7.6 vs 51.2±9.6, P=0.01), depression (52.2±9.2 vs 57.0±8.9, P=0.001), positive affect (46.6±8.9 vs 42.9±8.7, P=0.01), meaning and purpose (49.9±10.7 vs 46.2±10.5, P=0.03), global mental health (46.7±7.6 vs 43.1±9.2, P=0.01), and social isolation (52.2±7.5 vs 55.4±7.4, P=0.01). Multivariable analysis to account for the effects of other gender-affirming surgeries, hormone therapy duration, preexisting mental health diagnoses, socioeconomic disparities, and patient-reported quality of social relationships on psychosocial functioning demonstrated that completion of FFS was independently predictive of improved scores. Conclusions: Gender-affirming FFS improves the quality of life by multiple psychosocial domains in transfeminine patients.  © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."

Eating disorder symptoms and comorbid mental health risk among teens recruited to a digital intervention research study via two online approaches. . https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.24186","Introduction: It is crucial to identify and evaluate feasible, proactive ways to reach teens with eating disorders (EDs) who may not otherwise have access to screening or treatment. This study aimed to explore the feasibility of recruiting teens with EDs to a digital intervention study via social media and a publicly available online ED screen, and to compare the characteristics of teens recruited by each approach in an exploratory fashion. Method: Teens aged 14–17 years old who screened positive for a clinical/subclinical ED or at risk for an ED and who were not currently in ED treatment completed a baseline survey to assess current ED symptoms, mental health comorbidities, and barriers to treatment. Bivariate analyses were conducted to examine differences between participants recruited via social media and those recruited after completion of a widely available online EDs screen (i.e., National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA] screen). Results: Recruitment of teens with EDs using the two online approaches was found to be feasible, with 934 screens completed and a total of 134 teens enrolled over 6 months: 77% (n = 103) via social media 23% (n = 31) via the NEDA screen. Mean age of participants (N = 134) was 16 years old, with 49% (n = 66) identifying as non-White, and 70% (n = 94) identifying as a gender and/or sexual minority. Teens from NEDA reported higher ED psychopathology scores (medium effect size) and more frequent self-induced vomiting and driven exercise (small effect sizes). Teens from NEDA also endorsed more barriers to treatment, including not feeling ready for treatment and not knowing where to find a counselor or other resources (small effect sizes). Discussion: Online recruitment approaches in this study reached a large number of teens with an interest in a digital intervention to support ED recovery, demonstrating the feasibility of these outreach methods. Both approaches reached teens with similar demographic characteristics; however, teens recruited from NEDA reported higher ED symptom severity and barriers to treatment. Findings suggest that proactive assessment and intervention methods should be developed and tailored to meet the needs of each of these groups. Public Significance: This study examined the feasibility of recruiting teens with EDs to a digital intervention research study via social media and NEDA's online screen, and demonstrated differences in ED symptoms among participants by recruitment approach. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

Gender minority stress in transgender people: a major role for social network. . https://doi.org/10.1093/jsxmed/qdad043","Background: Gender minority individuals, on average, experience higher rates of mental health problems. Mounting work suggests that gender minority stress (GMS) contributes to mental health outcomes in transgender/gender-nonconforming individuals. Aim: We assessed whether GMS decreased in transgender people after initiating gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT), and we identified social predictors and hormonal associations for GMS at 2 time points. Methods: GMS was surveyed through self-report questionnaires tapping into proximal and distal stressors and coping constructs following the minority stress framework. Eighty-five transgender persons wishing to undertake hormonal interventions were assessed prospectively at start of GAHT and after 7.7 ± 3.5 months (mean ± SD). Sixty-five cisgender persons served as a control group. Outcomes: (1) Proximal stressors were surveyed by the Beck Depression Inventory II, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Scale for Suicide Ideation, Suicidal Thoughts/Attempts, Stigma Consciousness Questionnaire, and Perceived Stress Scale; (2) distal stressors by the Everyday Discrimination Scale; and (3) coping constructs by the Resilience Scale, social network, social standing, and Marlowe Crowne Social Desirability Scale. Results: Transgender people experienced higher rates of proximal stressors (Beck Depression Inventory II, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Scale for Suicide Ideation, Suicidal Thoughts/Attempts, Perceived Stress Scale) and had lower protective factors (social standing) prior to and during GAHT than cisgender people. Social network and resilience were lower in transgender people relative to cisgender peers only at baseline. Prospectively, decreasing trait anxiety was observed in transgender people. Social factors were adequate predictors of multiple GMS constructs. Specifically, a major role for social network emerged. As for hormonal associations, only serum estradiol levels in transgender women with GAHT were negatively associated with trait anxiety and suicidal thoughts/attempts but positively with resilience and social desirability. Clinical Implications: Stimulating a social environment supportive of diverse identities, particularly by investing in social networks as a resource for resilience, is likely to alleviate GMS. Strengths and Limitations: Longer duration of interventions with sex steroid treatment, with continued resilience-enhancing strategies, is needed to observe further alleviation of GMS in transgender persons. Also, objective and subjective GMS identification with heteronormative attitudes and beliefs should be surveyed for good measure when assessing GMS. Conclusion: Transgender people experienced more GMS throughout study visits than cisgender people did. With a relatively short period of GAHT, some significant changes in and predictors for experienced GMS emerged. © The Author(s) 2023.

FD is related to mental illness, but the correlation is poorly defined in the pediatric population. Our study aims to investigate the risk of psychiatric disorders diagnosed after the FD diagnosis in children and adolescents. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study over a seven-year period (2016–2022) to measure the incidence and risk ratio of psychiatric disorders in patients under age 19 years. The FD cohort was defined as patients with FD (International Classification of Diseases, ICD-10-CM: L98.1); the control cohort was defined as patients who attended a regular dermatology visit by applying a diagnostic code of disease of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (ICD-10-CM: L00–99). Results: A total of 453 patients were identified for analysis. We found that FD patients were more likely to be diagnosed with anxiety disorder (Relative risk [RR] 7.63; P < 0.001), obsessive-compulsive disorder (RR 6.20; P < 0.001), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (RR 4.90, P < 0.001), depression (RR 2.27; p = 0.02), sleep disorder (RR 2.23; P = 0.01), impulse disorder (RR 2.20; P = 0.04), and conduct disorder (RR 2.14; P = 0.04) within 1 year following the diagnosis of FD. Conclusion: FD is highly comorbid with psychiatric disorders. Though some practitioners believe FD could result from experimental or recreational behavior in children and adolescents, possible underlying psychiatric disorders should never be overlooked. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."

By combining self-reported health data with clinical evaluations and incorporating demographic and clinical variables, the research offers a robust and previously unavailable health profile of this population. Methods: An anonymous online survey targeting TGD adults across Italy was conducted from June 2020 to June 2021. The survey consisted of self-reported health assessments and clinician-conducted evaluations, collecting data on chronic physical conditions, mental health disorders, infectious diseases, and gender-affirming care. Statistical analyses, including chi-square tests and logistic regression, identified associations between demographics and health outcomes. Results: Among 959 participants, mental health disorders were prevalent, with over half experiencing depression and/or anxiety. Non-binary individuals reported poorer health compared to binary individuals. Chronic conditions such as thyroid disorders were more common in individuals assigned female at birth (AFAB), whereas those assigned male at birth (AMAB) had higher rates of osteoporosis and sexually transmitted infections. Key health predictors included age, education, employment, and engagement in gender-affirming hormone therapy. Conclusion: The study reveals stark health disparities among TGD individuals in Italy, emphasizing the need for targeted health policies, expanded mental health services, and specialized healthcare provider training. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE) 2025."

Adolescent patient perspectives on family‐based treatment: a pilot study. . https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.24403","Objective: Family-based treatment (FBT) is the recommended first-line treatment for adolescent eating disorders (EDs), yet evidence suggests it is effective for only 50% of youth. Ambivalence about initiating treatment and/or recovery predicts treatment nonresponse for youth with other psychiatric disorders and may also contribute to poor FBT outcomes. Thus, understanding patient perspectives on FBT is essential to mitigating challenges to treatment acceptance, with great potential for improving treatment efficacy. Methods: A qualitative, inductive approach was used to develop hypotheses about adolescents' perspectives on FBT and patient-perceived facilitators of ED recovery. Semi-structured interview data were analyzed using a grounded theory methodology. Results: Interviewees (N = 10) expressed ambivalence toward FBT—particularly its use of parental empowerment and pragmatic focus on weight recovery. Many participants stated that FBT was effective, necessary for recovery, and improved relationships with caregivers; however, some reported that a perceived lack of agency and sidelining of psychosocial distress and family conflict negatively impacted their treatment engagement. Regarding ED recovery, participants reported a preference for cognitive/emotional aspects of recovery and framed recovery as an ongoing or lifelong process. Peer support was identified as an important facilitator of behavior change. Discussion: Findings support addressing adolescent concerns (e.g., psychosocial well-being, agency, connection with peers, and family relationships) within the FBT framework. Results may inform future FBT implementation and adaptation and suggest the need for continued investigation of the treatment experience from multiple perspectives (i.e., patients, family members, and clinicians). © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

Research suggests that LBW are vulnerable to both traditional risk factors for binge eating found in general samples of women (e.g., emotion dysregulation) and risk factors specific to their sexual minority identity (e.g., experiences of heterosexist discrimination). This study tested a within-person model of binge eating in a sample of 233 young adult cisgender LBW. The model was based on the psychological mediation framework. Participants completed online surveys assessing binge eating, internalized stigma, depressive symptoms, and experiences with heterosexist discrimination every evening for a period of 9 days. Data were analyzed using dynamic structural equation modeling. Approximately 22.3% of participants reported at least one binge eating episode during the study period. Results provided partial support for the psychological mediation framework. Same-day discrimination, but not previous-day discrimination, indirectly predicted binge eating through the mediator of depressive symptoms. Internalized stigma was unrelated to binge eating. Body appreciation moderated the within-person association between depressive symptoms and binge eating, such that women with higher levels of body appreciation exhibited a weaker association between these variables. Sexual orientation and sense of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer community membership did not moderate the associations between discrimination, internalized stigma, or depressive symptoms and binge eating. Results reveal the importance of investigating the complex relations between general psychological and sexual minority-specific risk factors when attempting to understand elevated rates of psychopathology among sexual minority populations. Little research has examined the predictors of binge eating among lesbian and bisexual women. The present study demonstrates that depressive symptoms and experiences of heterosexist discrimination are associated with binge eating in this population. © 2025 American Psychological Association"

The prevalence of eating disorders among transgender and nonbinary (TGNB) adolescents and young adults (AYA) ranges from 5% to 18% and studies have found a higher risk of disordered eating among these AYA in comparison to their cisgender peers. However, there is minimal research on why TGNB AYA are at higher risk. The aim of this study is to understand unique factors that define a TGNB AYA's relationship between their body and food, how this relationship may be affected by gender-affirming medical care, and how these relationships may contribute to disordered eating. Methods: A total of 23 TGNB AYA were recruited from a multidisciplinary gender-affirming clinic to participate in semistructured interviews. Transcripts were analyzed using Braun and Clarke's theory of thematic analysis (2006). Results: The average age of participants was 16.9 years. Forty-four percent of participants identified as having a transfeminine gender identity, 39% transmasculine, and 17% nonbinary/gender fluid. Five themes emerged regarding TGNB participants' relationship to food and exercise: gender dysphoria and control over one's body, societal expectations of gender, mental health and safety concerns, emotional and physical changes with gender-affirming medical care, and recommended resources for TGNB AYA. Conclusion: By understanding these unique factors, clinicians can provide targeted and sensitive care when screening and managing disordered eating among TGNB AYA.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between gender identity, gender affirming interventions such as gender affirming hormones (GAH) and gender affirming surgeries (GAS), and ED symptomatology. Method: Transgender patients at a primary care outpatient gender health program in the United States completed a survey consisting of demographics, medical history, and clinical variables, including the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q). Multivariate analyses of covariance were conducted to compare EDE-Q scores across gender identity and gender affirmation. Results: Compared to transgender men (n = 79), transgender women (n = 87) reported higher EDE-Q scores and significantly higher Eating Concern. Compared to hormone/surgery-naïve and hormone-experienced/surgery-naïve patients, hormone/surgery-experienced patients had lower EDE-Q scores. Hormone/surgery-experienced patients reported significantly lower Shape Concern and marginally lower Global Score and Weight Concern than hormone-experienced/surgery-naïve patients. There were no differences in EDE-Q scores between hormone/surgery-naïve and hormone-experienced/surgery-naïve patients. Discussion: Transgender patients report high levels of ED symptomatology. There are subtle, yet important, differences in ED between gender identities and gender affirmations. High ED prevalence may result from the dual pathways of sociocultural pressures as well as gender dysphoria. Both GAH and GAS may be effective interventions to support gender affirmation and thereby alleviate ED symptomatology. While the potential positive benefits of GAS on ED are more apparent, the effects of GAH are less clear. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

Although parental care and overprotection in childhood influence later attachment and mental health in the general adult population, this has not been investigated in the autistic population. Likewise, the roles of psychological inflexibility and social engagement in influencing mental health outcomes for autistic adults have yet to be examined. Aims: To examine if retrospectively recalled childhood experiences of parental care and overprotection, as well as current adult attachment, psychological inflexibility and social engagement are associated with mental health in autistic adulthood. Further, to examine mediators of the association between parental care and overprotection and mental health in autistic adults. Methods and procedures: A community-recruited convenience sample of 126 Australian autistic adults completed an online survey assessing childhood experiences of parental care and overprotection and current adult attachment, psychological inflexibility, social engagement, and mental health. Outcomes and results: Linear regressions showed that psychological inflexibility was the strongest predictor of depression, anxiety, and stress, followed by attachment anxiety (depression, anxiety) and attachment avoidance (anxiety, stress). Mediation analyses revealed that psychological inflexibility and attachment anxiety mediated the associations between parental care and overprotection and mental health outcomes in autistic adulthood. Conclusions and implications: Psychological inflexibility and adult attachment (anxious and avoidant attachment) are important to understanding mental health of autistic adults. Psychological inflexibility and attachment anxiety mediate associations between recalled childhood experiences of parental care and overprotection and mental health in autistic adulthood. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

Primary care considerations for transgender and gender-diverse youth. . https://doi.org/10.1542/pir.2018-0194","Growing evidence reflects the value of using an ecological, gender-affirming approach to TGD youth in all settings, but especially in primary care. Supportive acceptance from a known PPCP can facilitate medical and psychosocial supports that will enable TGD youth to live their authentic gender experience at home, at school, and in their community. • Based on strong recommendations B, C, and D, a pediatric gender-affirmative care model acknowledges an individual's unique gender experience within their developmental process. It naturally builds on the family-centered, strength-based focus of primary care pediatrics to foster positive development through open communication, empathy, and resiliency. • Based on strong recommendations B and C, transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) youth may present to the clinical setting with heightened distress as they go through the physical and emotional changes of puberty. TGD youth may not explicitly identify gender concerns but might instead exhibit high-risk behaviors and social disengagement (eg, school failure, social isolation, substance use, self-harm, disordered eating, high-risk sexual behaviors). • Based on strong recommendations C, D, and X, PPCPs play an essential role in identifying and normalizing gender diversity early so that family support and understanding can be established. This is achieved through routine gender screening and anticipatory guidance throughout childhood. • Based on strong recommendations C, D, and X, early identification provides increased engagement and support, timely targeted planning and treatment options, and an increased likelihood that the TGD youth's ongoing development will be congruent with their asserted gender identity. • Based on strong recommendations B, C, D, and X, there is growing understanding and research regarding best practice in gender care for children and adolescents. This knowledge base will continue to evolve, but current best practices support a gender-affirmative approach throughout childhood and adolescence. Approaches that force children to suppress rather than explore their authentic self, or that deny access to appropriate medical care and emotional supports, are detrimental to childhood health and well-being.

While research suggests that romantic partners have the potential to support ED recovery, partners to those with EDs often report feeling confused and helpless in the face of the condition. The extant literature on EDs in relationships centers on the experiences of cisgender, heterosexual women. The present study aimed to garner a more comprehensive understanding of the types of support people with EDs believe are most helpful from romantic partners by analyzing relationship advice from a diverse group of individuals with EDs who were in romantic relationships. As part of a larger study on romantic relationships in ED recovery, we analyzed responses to the question, “If you had to give one piece of advice to someone who learns that their partner has an ED, what would it be?” Through Consensual Qualitative Research-Modified, we identified 29 themes, which we grouped into 7 domains: Foster Open Communication, Create an Environment of Emotional Intimacy, Let Your Partner Guide You, Educate Yourself, Be Compassionate with Yourself, Use Caution when Discussing Food and Bodies, and a Miscellaneous domain. These findings highlight the importance of patience, flexibility, psychoeducation, and self-compassion for individuals working to support their partner’s ED recovery, and can inform future couples-based treatments and interventions for EDs. © 2023 Taylor & Francis."

Specific sub-topics examined include 1) dietary intake, 2) nutrition-related health disparities, 3) validity and reliability of nutrition assessment methods, 4) the effects of nutrition interventions/exposures, and 5) hormone therapy. Methods: A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and other databases for peer-reviewed articles published from January 1999 until December 5, 2019 to identify studies addressing the research objective and meeting eligibility criteria. Conference abstracts and registered trials published or registered in the five years prior to the search were also included. Findings were reported in a study characteristics table, a bubble chart and heat maps. Results: The search of the databases identified 5403 studies, including full peer-reviewed studies, systematic reviews, conference abstracts and registered trials. Following title/abstract screening, 189 studies were included in the narrative analysis. Ten studies reported dietary intake in transgender individuals, 64 studies reported nutrition-related health disparities in transgender compared to cisgender individuals, one study examined validity and reliability of nutrition assessment methods, two studies reported nutrition interventions, and 127 studies reported on the intermediate and health effects of hormone therapy. Conclusion: Individuals who are transgender have unique nutrition needs, which may vary according to the stage and type of gender-affirmative therapy that they are undergoing. There is scant research examining effective nutrition therapy methods for nutrition professionals working with transgender individuals. More research is needed in order to inform evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for nutrition practitioners working with transgender individuals. © 2020 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism"

However, only a limited number of categories of pathology have been diagnosed in some chimpanzees exclusively by using adapted versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). With this in mind, we have created a questionnaire for the assessment of psychopathologies in 23 rescued ex-performer and ex-pet chimpanzees, based on an inclusion-exclusion adaptation of the fifth edition of the DSM. A total of 70 items were retained for the Chimpanzee Psychopathology Questionnaire in accordance with 3 main criteria: deleting those that could not be applied to the subjects, retaining those that could be applied, and adapted when needed. Principal component analysis and regularized exploratory factor analysis revealed 9 statistically significant factors with acceptable standards of interrater reliability and validity, accounting for 70.78 % of the variance. The factors obtained were clear and similar to some of the main categories of diagnosis for humans. Nevertheless, the limitation of the sample, the subjectivity in the creation of the questionnaire, as well as the theoretical and methodological challenges of the adaptation of the DSM to chimpanzees, led to the fact that this research should be considered as a first contact study on the identification of disorder categories in a group of chimpanzees. The main purpose of this study is to start a debate to promote research on psychopathology in chimpanzees and other animals. Likewise, it is important to emphasize that the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in chimpanzees could be translated to important pragmatic aspects for the species related to awareness, legal implications, welfare, and comparative psychopathology. © 2020 Elsevier Inc."

Decades of research and meta-analytic findings have supported the notion that client expectations about what will happen over the course of therapy and how beneficial therapy will be are directly related to treatment factors, such as the working alliance and treatment outcome. Client expectations can be categorized into two broad categories, outcome expectations (i.e., how beneficial treatment will be) and treatment expectations (i.e., what will happen in treatment). This study sought to examine clients’ treatment expectations, specifically, their role expectations, which represent their beliefs of how their therapists will act in session. Data for this study included 1,233 clients participating in individual counseling with 49 therapists at a university counseling center. Multilevel polynomial regression and response surface analysis were used to test congruent and discrepant effects of clients’ pretreatment support and challenge expectancy on reductions in their psychological distress over the course of treatment. Results indicated that reductions in clients’ psychological distress were the greatest when their support and challenge expectancy scores were congruent and high. In other words, clients who expected both high challenge and high support from their therapist, prior to the start of counseling, reported the greatest improvement in counseling. Clients similarly reported reductions in their psychological distress when their support and challenge expectations were congruent and low, although this effect was smaller than when they expected high levels of both support and challenge. Together, these findings suggest that when clients’ expectations of support and challenge are similar, they fare better in treatment, as opposed to when they expect a greater amount of support than challenge or vice versa. © 2022 American Psychological Association"

Prevalence and correlates of prescription stimulant misuse among us college students. . https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.22m14420","Objective: There is a high prevalence of prescription stimulant misuse (PSM) among college students in the United States (US). Preventing and identifying PSM requires an understanding of risk factors and correlates, but large-scale surveys regarding this issue have been lacking. We present the largest multiinstitution study to date on the correlates of PSM among US college students. Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of the 2017 American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment (ACHA-NCHA), an annual national survey on the demographics, health, and academic experiences of US college students. Logistic regression models examined associations between past-year PSM in 40,645 undergraduate college students and hypothesized risk factors. Results: PSM was reported in 8% of college students. PSM was associated with past-year diagnosis or treatment of depression (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.16; 99% CI, 1.01-1.33), anorexia (AOR = 1.44; 99% CI, 1.02-2.03), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AOR = 1.66; 99% CI, 1.41-1.95), and substance use disorder/other addiction (AOR = 1.79; 99% CI, 1.30-2.46). The odds of PSM were 5.5 times higher for students who endorsed past-month use of ""Legal drugs""and 8 times higher for students who endorsed past-month use of ""Illegal drugs""than for those who did not. Other factors associated with PSM included academic difficulty, daytime sleepiness, fraternity or sorority involvement, White race, and cis-male gender. Conclusions: This study identifies many potential risk factors for PSM among US undergraduate college students. Targeted outreach, prevention, and clinical management are discussed. As the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated psychiatric distress, sleep difficulties, substance use, and attentional challenges among college students, this study may serve as a baseline for future studies examining the impact of COVID-19 on PSM among college students.  © 2022 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc."

However, discussions of sexual minority populations are often focused on aspects of mental health associated with sexual orientation, with relatively less emphasis placed on transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals’ mental health. No prior studies have compared psychiatric diagnoses between TGD and cisgender patients presenting for psychiatric treatment in a systematic way using semistructured diagnostic interviews assessing a broad range of disorders. Methods: Between April 2014 and January 2021, we administered semistructured diagnostic interviews for DSM-IV disorders to 2,212 psychiatric patients, 69 of whom reported TGD identity (ie, gender identity other than cisgender such as transgender, genderqueer, or nonbinary identity). The patients completed a demographic questionnaire on which they indicated their assigned sex at birth and their current gender identity. Results: TGD patients had on average more diagnoses than cisgender patients (3.54 ± 1.88 vs 3.04 ± 1.72, t= 2.37, P= .02). After controlling for age, TGD patients were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder and borderline personality disorder than cisgender patients (P< .05). Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of psychiatric patients using semistructured diagnostic interviews to compare the frequency of psychiatric disorders between cisgender and TGD patients. These results bear implications for creating gender-inclusive treatment facilities. Psychiatry programs interested in qualifying as Safe Zones and treating TGD patients should have or develop expertise in treating posttraumatic stress disorder and borderline personality disorder. © 2022 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc."

Yet trans and nonbinary individuals (TNB) may be at greater risk than cisgender individuals to suffer from eating disorders, disordered eating, and body image concerns. The current study takes a phenomenological approach to explore how TNB individuals conceptualize eating and/or body image issues. Qualitative data were obtained from 82 TNB participants who self-reported eating and/or body image concerns. Primary analyses focused on participants’ responses to an open-ended prompt regarding how participants understand the relationships among gender identity, gender expression, and weight and shape control behaviors. Thematic analysis identified five themes: (a) gender dysphoria, (b) puberty, (c) emotion (dys)regulation, (d) gender expression, and (e) recovery/transition. Results indicate various factors salient to gender identity and expression and eating concerns. Findings extend beyond the traditional focus on gender dysphoria by highlighting other important factors for TNB individuals, such as the function ED psychopathology serves (e.g., gender avoidance and self-punishment). This broadens the ED field’s understanding of how gender dysphoria relates to ED psychopathology, rather than focusing solely on the physical body. Distress and associated behaviors related to both gender dysphoria and eating disorder psychopathology may be reciprocal and reinforcing and, as such, should be considered in tandem in treating TNB clients experiencing EDs and body image concerns. This work may better identify ED risk and maintenance within this population and thus optimize prevention and intervention. © 2022 American Psychological Association"

Preliminary research has shown associations between vaping and eating disorder symptoms, however, there remain gaps in this knowledge among college students. The aim of this study was to determine the associations between vaping and a self-reported lifetime eating disorder diagnosis and eating disorder risk among a large sample of college students. Cross-sectional data from the 2018-2019 national (U.S.) Healthy Minds Study (n = 51,231) were analyzed. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the unadjusted and adjusted associations between vaping or e-cigarette use in the past 30 days and a self-reported lifetime eating disorder diagnosis (any diagnosis, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder) and eating disorder risk (SCOFF). Among the sample, 19.0% of participants reported vaping or e-cigarette use in the past 30 days, 3.7% self-reported any lifetime eating disorder diagnosis, and 25.0% were at elevated risk for an eating disorder. Vaping or e-cigarette use was associated with higher odds of all eating disorder measures, including the self-reported lifetime eating disorder diagnosis items (any diagnosis, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder) and elevated eating disorder risk, while adjusting for demographic and confounding variables. Among a large sample of college students, vaping or e-cigarette use was associated with a self-reported lifetime eating disorder diagnosis and elevated eating disorder risk, which may exacerbate the many medical complications associated with eating disorder behaviors.

People who identify themselves as transgender people are more vulnerable and may have higher rates of dissatisfaction with their bodies which are often associated with a disorderly diet in an attempt to change the bodily characteristics of the genus of birth and, conversely, to accentuate the characteristics of the desired sexual identity. Aim: The purpose of this work is to examine the association between dissatisfaction with one’s own body and eating and weight disorders in people with gender dysphoria. Results: Gender dysphoria and eating disorders are characterized by a serious discomfort tothe body and the body suffers in both conditions. The results of our study suggest that rates of pathological eating behaviors and symptoms related to a disordered diet are high in patients with gender dysphoria and that standard screening for these symptoms must be considered in both populations at the time of evaluation and during the course of the treatment. Conclusion: In light of this evidence, clinicians should always investigate issues related to sexuality and gender identity in patients with eating disorders, to develop more effective prevention measures and better strategies for therapeutic intervention. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers."

As members of a gender minority, transgender individuals face many challenges. Many experience distress, depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation related to gender nonconformity and transphobia. Stress and trauma may contribute to the development of fibromyalgia (FM) syndrome, characterised by widespread pain and fatigue. The prevalence of FM among transgenders is not known. Methods. Transgender participants were recruited at a specialised clinic. Questionnaires included the Widespread Pain Index (WPI), the Symptom Severity Score (SSS) and the SF-36. Data concerning hormonal treatment protocols was retrieved from charts. The current prevalence of FM was determined, as well as the prevalence before and after testosterone treatment among TM. Pearson correlations were calculated between all measures. Results. 115 participants were recruited, 62.6% transgender men (TM), 37.4% transgender women (TW). 17 individuals (14.8%) fulfilled the 2011 modified ACR FM criteria, for a rate of 19.4% among TM and 6.98% among TW. Among TM, FM was associated with younger age, smoking and SF-36 sub-scales related to physical functioning, role limitation due to physical pain, fatigue, pain and general health. Among TW, FM was associated with social status, employment, depression, existing medical treatment and substance abuse, as well as SF-36 subscales related to role limitations affected due to pain. Conclusion. Fibromyalgia symptoms are highly prevalent among Israeli transgender individuals and may be related to psychological distress and gender dysphoria. Healthcare professionals treating transgenders should remain vigilant for the occurrence of chronic pain, fatigue and other FM-related symptoms and be prepared to treat and/or refer such patients accordingly. © Copyright CliniCal and ExpErimEntal rhEumatology 2021."

A case series on disordered eating among transgender youth with autism spectrum disorder. . https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.12.143","Transgender youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may experience complex relationships with eating because of cognitive rigidity, including inflexible thoughts and behaviors around food and/or their body. Yet, there is no research that provides guidance to clinicians providing care for youth with the unique triad of gender dysphoria, ASD, and disordered eating. This case series discusses trends in presentation and management of three cases from a multidisciplinary gender care clinic. All three individuals endorsed rigid thoughts around food and/or body appearance, which affected nutritional intake; however, their presenting eating disorder behaviors, described etiology for disordered thoughts, diagnosis, and level of engagement in a multidisciplinary treatment model varied. Based on these cases we hypothesize several strategies including early engagement with ASD specialists, proactive screening and discussions around eating with all transgender youth with suspected/confirmed ASD, continued discussions throughout care, as disordered eating behaviors may change after the initiation of gender-affirming medications, dietician visits early in treatment regardless of endorsed thoughts and behaviors, tailored management to the unique needs of each individual and their eating thoughts/behaviors, and consistent multidisciplinary collaboration. © 2021 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine"

A cross-sectional survey containing the study’s measures of interest were administered to participants. The final sample consisted of 180 sexual minority Asian American men. Both sexual racism and internalized racism were positively associated with disordered eating whereas gendered racism was not associated with disordered eating Emotional eating mediated the association between internalized racism and disordered eating, though it did not mediate the association between sexual racism and disordered eating. Researchers and practitioners are encouraged to utilize an intersectional framework that takes into account multiple forms of racism, especially sexual racism and internalized racism, when considering this underrepresented population’s disordered eating.

These early traumas may interfere with the process of integrating the mind and body. Symptoms of gender dysphoria often arise from, or increase in response to, subsequent separations later in life, as individuals transition from childhood to adulthood. Increased referrals to gender clinics are noted at puberty or the point of separation from the family, as individuals face the prospect of leaving home to go to university. Affected by anxieties associated with the onset of puberty or separation anxieties, these individuals sometimes seek a medical transition to gain control over their bodies. Exploring underlying psychoanalytic issues can help clinicians assess various conscious and unconscious influences, and help patients make more informed decisions on whether to pursue a medical transition. A focus on defence mechanisms and forms of thinking can help clinicians find ways of working with individuals who may be highly defensive and concrete in their thinking and feel threatened by the functioning of their minds. © 2023 Association of Child Psychotherapists."

Food literacy is a related construct that may also impact disordered eating; however, research on these relationships is limited. It is also not well understood if food security and food literacy relate to disordered eating behaviors differently for LGBTQ and heterosexual individuals. The current study examined these constructs in a sample of college students (n = 572; 22 % LGBTQ), as well as examined sexual orientation as a moderator in the relationship between food insecurity/food literacy and disordered eating outcomes. Results showed that LGBTQ individuals reported greater dieting/restricting, bulimia symptoms, oral control, and binge eating symptoms than heterosexual peers. LGBTQ students were also more likely to be food insecure and had significantly lower food literacy than heterosexual students. Sexual orientation significantly moderated the relationships between food insecurity and overall disordered eating, and between food insecurity and dieting/restricting behaviors. These relationships showed that very low food security was strongly related to disordered eating symptoms for LGBTQ individuals. Sexual orientation did not moderate the relationship between food literacy and disordered eating outcomes. These findings contribute to the overall literature on food insecurity and disordered eating for the LGBTQ community through replicating past findings, and also provide new information about relationships between food literacy, food insecurity, disordered eating, and the role of sexual orientation."

We propose a Misgendering-Congruence Process by which being misgendered (i.e., labeled a gender other than that with which one identifies) could lead transgender individuals to feel greater incongruence between their bodies and internal identities, which in turn leads to body dissatisfaction and efforts to bring one's body in line with one's identified gender by engaging in weight and shape control behaviors such as dietary restraint.Method One hundred and thirty transgender individuals completed measures of misgendering frequency, transgender congruence, body dissatisfaction, and dietary restraint.Results Mediation analyses provided preliminary support for the Misgendering-Congruence Process when conducted with the overall sample as well as with transgender subgroups: transgender women (n = 41), transgender men (n = 42), and nonbinary transgender individuals (n = 47).Discussion Social recognition of transgender people's gender identities appears to play a unique role in their body satisfaction and restrained eating behaviors."

METHODS: Participants completed an abbreviated version of the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months after establishing care in a gender clinic. We analyzed descriptive statistics and multivariate linear regression analyses. RESULTS: Of the 91 TGNB adolescent participants, 61% were transmasculine, 30% transfeminine, and 7% nonbinary/gender-fluid. Among TGNB adolescents, disordered eating thoughts/behaviors were frequently endorsed with 26% of participants engaging in any occurrence of binge eating, 27% limiting the amount of food they ate, and 30% excluding foods from their diet. Forty percent of participants reported any occurrence of at least 1 disordered eating behavior and 17% at least 3 behaviors. Abbreviated EDE-Q responses did not differ significantly by sex assigned at birth, gender identity, gender affirming medications, or time spent receiving gender -affirming care. There was a significant effect of age (P value = .003) on abbreviated EDE-Q scores.CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant changes in disordered eating after initiating gender-affirming medical care, possibly due to the limited study time frame of 12 months. Given the high prevalence of disordered eating behaviors, clinicians should consider screening all TGNB adolescents for disordered eating thoughts/behaviors throughout gender affirming care. Future longitudinal research should recruit larger samples with a diverse range of gender identities and survey disordered eating thoughts/behaviors at least one year after starting gender-affirming medications."

As having a negative body image is related to negative mood, sexual, and health outcomes, identifying and providing community-friendly tools for GBQ men is important. This paper describes the creation and evaluation of Rainbow Reflections, a comic anthology developed to promote awareness of and communication about body image. Rainbow Reflections includes comics from 38 trans- and cis-GBQ artists who drew inspiration from personal narratives based on pre-determined themes in the empirical literature and interactive inserts based on evidence-based practice. To evaluate Rainbow Reflections, 167 trans- and cis-GBQ men completed pre-post measures before/after viewing a selection of comics and responded to an open-ended question about their experience. Overall, participants rated the comic book positively, with a majority (61.1%) indicating that they would recommend the book to a friend. After viewing the comics, participants reported greater comfort with initiating conversations about body image, greater satisfaction with their bodies, and reported higher estimates of how common body image concerns are for queer men. Themes that emerged from open-ended responses included participants reflecting on personal struggles (similar to 30%), relating with the stories of others (similar to 22%), reflecting on the standards of queer men (similar to 18%), recognizing cis-privilege (similar to 11%), reflecting on others' struggles (similar to 9%), negative feedback about the comics (similar to 7%), and balancing masculine and feminine (similar to 3%). Results of the study provide preliminary evidence for Rainbow Reflections as an effective community-friendly tool to promote awareness of and communication about body image for GBQ men."

Method: Trial 1 (N = 98; 80% female, 14% male, and 6% gender-expansive) piloted the two-session intervention delivered by an expert (faculty or staff) and peer cofacilitators compared to a waitlist control. Trial 2 (N = 141; 79% female, 15% male, and 6% gender-expansive) utilized peer leaders, comparing the EVERYbody Project to a video and expressive writing intervention. Around half of the participants in both trials self-identified in one or more specific marginalized identity category. Changes in eating disorder symptoms and risk factors were assessed through 1-month follow-up. Trial 1 also assessed the intervention's impact on students with marginalized identities through qualitative interviews. Results: In Trial 1, the EVERYbody Project produced greater reductions in eating disorder symptoms, internalized appearance norms, body dissatisfaction, and negative affect compared to the waitlist control through 1-month follow-up, with medium effect sizes. The impact was similar in students with marginalized and majority identities, and qualitative interviews suggested specific positives of the intervention. In Trial 2, there were significant changes in two of four outcomes for participants in the EVERYbody Project compared to the video and expressive writing intervention, but overall, the intervention impact was modest. Conclusions: The EVERYbody Project is a feasible and acceptable inclusive dissonance-based body image program. It appears to be beneficial when delivered via experts, but research is needed to establish whether the program can be delivered using peer leaders with greater impact."

Many APEDS are legally sold over-the-counter, however research has documented contamination of legal APEDS and many adverse effects of use. Despite this, little research has been conducted on legal APEDS use in Canada, particularly regarding the prevalence and sociodemographic predictors of use, which was the aim of this study.MethodsData from the Canadian Study of Adolescent Health Behaviors (N = 2,731) were analyzed. Prevalence and frequency of use of 10 common APEDS in the past 12 months were estimated overall and across genders. Multiple modified Poisson regression analyses were conducted to determine the sociodemographic predictors of APEDS use.ResultsOverall, use of caffeine was most common among the sample (71.3%), along with protein bars (63.4%), and whey protein powders or protein shakes (63.1%). Boys and men reported greater prevalence of use of eight of the 10 APEDS, with the exception of diuretics or water pills and probiotics, compared to girls and women and transgender/gender non-confirming participants. Over three quarters (82.5%) of boys and men reported use of whey protein powders or protein shakes and 50.3% reported use of creatine monohydrate. Use of APEDS varied based on several key sociodemographic identifiers.ConclusionsThis study is the first to document legal APEDS use among a sample of Canadian adolescents and young adults, providing important implications for health care and policymaking professionals. Further research is needed to gain greater insight into APEDS use among Canadian young people."

Data from the Canadian Study of Adolescent Health Behaviors (N = 2,719) were analyzed. Regression analyses were used to estimate the association between conformity to masculine gender norms and muscle dysmorphia symptomatology, clinical risk for muscle dysmorphia, and lifetime anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) use, among the overall sample and stratified by gender. Conformity to masculine gender norms was positively associated with muscle dysmorphia symptomatology, clinical risk for muscle dysmorphia, and lifetime AAS use among the sample. Moreover, findings were similar among boys and young men, girls and young women, and transgender/gender-expansive participants. Findings underscore the relevance of masculine gender norms in relation to the pursuit of muscularity among adolescents and young adults. Future research is needed to explore the specific mechanisms underlying the link between conformity to masculine gender norms and muscle dysmorphia symptomatology across genders."

Participants were diverse with regard to age (M = 34.19, SD = 12.02) and ethnoracial background (e.g., 29.0% His-panic/Latinx, 17.2% Black/African American, 6.5% American Indian/Alaska Native; 5.4% multiracial). Results demonstrated both models' abilities to explain body dissat-isfaction and disordered eating independently, except for the relationship between body dissatisfaction and the thinness-oriented TI model. An integration of the models better explained body dissatisfaction and disordered eating compared to either model alone. Notably, some findings did not align with the two frameworks, suggesting existing models may not adequately describe pathways through which disordered eating emerges in TGE populations. Specifically, body dissatisfaction showed no significant rela-tionship with disordered eating and was not well explained by the TI model, and higher gender identity pride was related to greater disordered eating symptoms. Implications for clinical care and future research are discussed."

(2021). Disparities in disordered eating between gender minority and cisgender adolescents. . https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23494","Objective Adolescence is a developmental period of increased risk for disordered eating. Gender minority adolescents (GMAs), or those whose gender identity does not align with their sex assigned at birth, may experience body image concerns related to unique gender-related stressors. GMAs may use disordered eating to affirm a feminine, masculine, or nonbinary gender identity. However, little is known about differences in disordered eating between GMAs and cisgender adolescents. Therefore, this study had two primary goals: (a) to compare disordered eating between GMAs and cisgender adolescents by examining the role of gender identity and sex assigned at birth; and (b) within GMAs, to examine associations between gender identity congruence and disordered eating.Method A large U.S. sample of GMAs and cisgender adolescents (n = 1,191 GMAs; 919 cisgender; M-age = 15.93 years) reported their disordered eating on an anonymous online survey.Results A MANOVA revealed a significant interaction between gender identity and sex assigned at birth. Follow-up ANOVAs demonstrated that purging, caloric restriction, excessive exercise, and muscle building differed as a function of gender identity and sex assigned at birth. Among GMAs, a multiple multivariate regression model demonstrated that disordered eating was lower among participants who reported greater gender identity congruence.Discussion GMAs should not be considered a homogenous group, as differences in gender identity may lead to the internalization of different appearance ideals and disparate eating disorder symptomatology. Results suggest that clinicians working with GMAs consider the unique body image concerns that could accompany a specific gender identity."

Method The EVERYbody Project was open to all college students and delivered by expert peer facilitators with body image and diversity experience and advanced facilitation skills. Recruitment was halted due to COVID-19; 90 students in the Northwest US (M age = 19.83 years, SD = 2.38; 80% female-identified, 13% male-identified, 7% gender expansive) were randomized to receive the EVERYbody Project or a video-based, low-dissonance comparison intervention. Results Around half of students (56%) held one or more specific socially marginalized identity (26% with a racial or ethnic identity other than white and non-Hispanic, 39% with a sexual identity other than straight, 7% with a gender identity other than cisgender). The EVERYbody Project produced greater reductions in three outcomes associated with poor body image (internalized appearance norms, body dissatisfaction, and negative affect) compared to the video intervention through 3-month follow-up (ps < .003) with medium between group effects. Both conditions experienced small reductions in eating disorder psychopathology over time. Discussion Expert peer facilitation may be a viable delivery model for inclusive, diversity-focused dissonance-based body image programs. Public Significance This study explored a novel facilitation approach for a diversity-focused body image program for college students. A brief (4 h) dissonance-based program was open to all college students and delivered by expert diverse peer leaders who were screened for facilitation readiness. Body image and related outcomes were improved through 3-month follow-up relative to a comparison condition, suggesting that expert peer facilitation may be a viable option for delivering universal, inclusive body image programming."

Despite purported benefits of this practice, such as increased energy due to the high con-centration of caffeine, there are potential harms of engagement. To date, no known empirical research has investigated dry scooping in epidemiological research. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize the prevalence and correlates of dry scooping among a sample of Canadian adolescents and young adults. Data from the Canadian Study of Adolescent Health Behaviors (N = 2731) were analyzed. Prevalence of any dry scooping in the past 12 months among the overall sample, and by gender, was estimated. Modified Poisson regression analysis was used to determine the adjusted associations between sociodemographic and descriptive charac-teristics and dry scooping. Overall, 16.9 % of the sample reported dry scooping in the past 12 months, which was significantly more common among men (21.8 %) compared to women (14.2 %) and transgender/gender non-confirming participants (8.0 %). Participants who reported weight training, greater time spent on social media, and clinically significant symptoms of muscle dysmorphia were more likely to report dry scooping, while sexual minorities, relative to heterosexual participants, and those with higher education were less likely to report dry scooping. This study is the first known epidemiological study of dry scooping, underscoring the common nature of this contemporary dietary behavior. Findings emphasize the need for future research and prevention and intervention efforts to protect the health and well-being of young people."

Yet, by comparison, this approach is not medically accepted for those who are experiencing muscle dysmorphia (MD), a specifier of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), despite both conditions reflecting incongruences between self-perception, identity and phenotype, and both currently being classified as mental health disorders. Rather, by stark contrast, those with MD are largely treated with psychological intervention to accept themselves as they physically are and the illicit use of testosterone for muscle-related body perception purposes is generally subject to criminal justice enforcement actions. In this commentary, we examine attempts to distinguish between the use of testosterone for gender-affirming hormone therapy in the case of GD and for aesthetic (muscle enhancement) use in the case of MD, as well as explore the implications of this disparity. Moreover, we consider how such disparity in policy and practice may be understood, in part, as an example of a bias reflecting the selective pathologizing of anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) use, socio-cultural evolutions in gender identity and expression and, more broadly, the manner in which culture defines disorder and its appropriate response."

The purpose of this study was to examine associations between ASD, GD, and MH diagnoses (anxiety, depression, eating disorder, suicidality, and self-harm) among US adolescent populations.METHODS This is a secondary analysis of a large administrative dataset formed by 8 pediatric health system members of the PEDSnet learning health system network. Analyses included descriptive statistics and adjusted mixed logistic regression models testing for associations between combinations of ASD and GD diagnoses and MH diagnoses as recorded in the patient's electronic medical record.RESULTS Based on data from 919 898 patients aged 9 to 18 years, adjusted mixed logistic regression indicated significantly greater odds of each MH diagnosis among those with ASD alone, GD alone, and cooccurring ASD/GD diagnoses compared with those with neither diagnosis. Youth with cooccurring ASD/GD were at significantly greater risk of also having anxiety (average predicted probability, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-0.81) or depression diagnoses (average predicted probability, 0.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.43) compared with youth with ASD alone, GD alone, or neither diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS Youth with cooccurring ASD/GD are more likely to also be diagnosed with MH concerns, particularly anxiety and depression. This study highlights the need to implement developmentally appropriate, gender-affirming MH services and interventions for youth with cooccurring ASD/GD."

Methods From November 2019 to January 2020, a survey was conducted using convenience sampling on Hornet in Thailand. HIV literacy was assessed via 22 questions, and multivariable linear regression was performed. Results 960 responses were assessed; median age was 34 years, the majority were MSM (80.4%), Thai (83.8%), had at least bachelor's degree (74.9%).

Empirical research shows that MBI significantly correlates with muscularity-oriented eating and body image disturbances. The Muscularity Bias Internalization Scale (MBIS) measures MBI and has been validated in general adult populations. Given that evidence supports a higher risk of eating and body image disturbances in Transgender and Gender-Diverse (TGD) people compared to their cis- gender counterparts, validating the MBIS in TGD people is essential to further clarifying disparities in eating and body image disturbances in this population. With a sample of 410 Chinese TGD adults, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a two-factor structure. Comparisons of the second-order and bifactor models favored the second-order model. The MBIS showed good internal consistency and sound construct validity. Strong measurement invariance was confirmed across transgender men, transgender women, and gender- diverse groups, suggesting that these groups interpreted the MBIS similarly and that conclusions of differences in MBI across TGD adults can be considered true group differences. Specifically, transgender men reported the highest MBIS scores, followed by gender-diverse individuals, and then transgender women. These findings suggested that the MBIS appears to be a psychometrically sound instrument of MBI in Chinese TGD adults."

As trans and nonbinary (TNB) individuals commonly experience prejudice and discrimination in response to their gender identities (i.e. minority stressors), rumination over these stressors may contribute to heightened risk of psychopathology in these groups. Although rumination is a general risk factor for eating disorder (ED) psychopathology, no studies to date have examined whether eating- or genderrelated ruminative patterns relate to maintenance of ED psychopathology for TNB individuals. This crosssectional study investigated whether levels of rumination (both gender-related and ED-specific) mediated the relationship between minority stress and ED psychopathology. Method: Participants were 242 TNB adults (Mage = 24.92, SD = 6.5, Range = 18-70) recruited online, who completed measures of minority stress, gender-related rumination, ED-specific rumination, and ED psychopathology. We used Preacher-Hayes' approach to examine the parallel mediation model, with gender-related and ED-specific rumination as potential mediators. Results: Gender-related rumination did not mediate the relation between gender minority stress and ED psychopathology, Indirect B = -0.00 [95% BCa CI: -0.01, 0.00]; however, ED-specific rumination was significant, indicating partial mediation, Indirect B = 0.01 [95% BCa CI: 0.00, 0.02]. Conclusion: As gender minority stress and ED-specific rumination relate to ED psychopathology, it is essential that clinicians adopt an intersectional minority stress framework in understanding ED psychopathology among TNB individuals."

For example, weight-based victimization was associated with approximately 2 more points on the depressive symptoms scale (beta = 1.81, P < .001), adjusting for covariates. Findings highlight the negative impact of weight-based victimization among LGBTQ youth, even in the context of other types of family support."

(2020). Can trans-syndromal prototypes (“types”) improve depiction of complex psychiatric cases?. . https://doi.org/10.1097/nmd.0000000000001261","Background and aims: In many psychiatric settings, patients with complex cases are the rule rather than the exception. These cases are characterized by multidiagnostic conditions, often complicated with distressed social contexts, for which few if any evidence-based practice guidelines exist. The aim of this hypothesis-generating article is to consider whether and how these cases might comprise trans-syndromal prototypes (types), coherent units that could serve as the basis for further study, assessment, and treatment planning. Methods: For context, psychiatric and medical visit diagnoses and problem lists noted among principle visit diagnoses and snapshot portions of electronic medical records were tabulated for 293 psychiatric outpatients seen consecutively during a 1-week period at a university psychiatric clinic. By considering resulting comorbidity patterns in these records from the perspectives of clinicians caring for these patients, several commonly encountered diagnostic-problem sets emerged as candidate types. Results: Of 293 patients, only 18% had a single diagnosis, 43% had two, 29% had three, and 7% had four or more noted. Occurring in assorted combinations, specific diagnostic areas noted included depressive disorders (68%, the large majority major depressive disorder recurrent), anxiety disorders (60%, the large majority generalized anxiety disorder, with or without panic disorder and/or social anxiety disorder), posttraumatic stress disorder (22%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (17%), alcohol and substance abuse disorders (16%), personality disorders (11%), and bipolar disorders (18%). Several illustrative candidate types emerging from this population are described including major anxious depressive disorder, anxiety disorder secondary to ADHD, complex emotional instability disorder, multi-impulsive eating disorder, substance-dependent impoverished personality disorder, painful mood disorder, and complex personal and cultural trauma disorder. Other potential types are identified as well. Conclusions and implications: The types described here are but a small selection, because other settings including community mental health centers, private practices, public and private hospitals, and forensic facilities see a variety of other types as well. The study of types might provide important findings about pathogenesis, course, outcome, and treatment to augment information obtained from examination of individual diagnostic components."

Obstacles to forming a positive body image and strategies for overcoming them: a qualitative study of nonbinary individuals’ experiences. . https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bodyim.2025.101932","Although limited research has explored body image trajectories (i.e., how body image evolves across time) among gender-diverse populations, previous studies suggest that nonbinary individuals have distinctive experiences with forming and maintaining positive body image. Moreover, nonbinary individuals, like members of other stigmatized groups, experience unique stressors tied to their marginalized gender identity, though no prior studies have investigated the role of minority stress in positive body image trajectories. The present study employs the gender minority stress framework to explore the obstacles nonbinary individuals face in forming positive body image and the coping strategies foundational to their resilience. We conducted a reflexive thematic analysis of in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 15 nonbinary individuals who scored high on a validated measure of positive body image (the Body Appreciation Scale-2). The analysis revealed eight key obstacles participants encountered as they sought to form a positive body image, such as confining and dangerous antiLGBTQ+ narratives, gender dysphoria, and familial expectation and religious beliefs. Participants leveraged six coping strategies, such as seeking therapy, resisting comparisons, and nurturing inner kindness and selfconsideration to overcome the obstacles they faced. Further, results illustrate how intersectionality with nonbinary identities (e.g., having health concerns or disabilities) creates distinct barriers to positive body image, thereby necessitating a unique, intertwining array of coping strategies. Together, these findings offer a valuable foundation to direct the creation of programs and interventions seeking to build positive body image in nonbinary populations and emphasize the need for diverse samples in positive body image research."

Peer support for discharge from inpatient mental health care versus care as usual in england (enrich): a parallel, two-group, individually randomised controlled trial. .","Background High numbers of patients discharged from psychiatric hospital care are readmitted within a year. Peer support for discharge has been suggested as an approach to reducing readmission post-discharge. Implementation has been called for in policy, however, evidence of effectiveness from large rigorous trials is missing. We aimed to establish whether peer support for discharge reduces readmissions in the year post-discharge.Methods We report a parallel, two-group, individually randomised, controlled superiority trial, with trial personnel masked to allocation. Patients were adult psychiatric inpatients (age >= 18 years) with at least one previous admission in the preceding 2 years, excluding those who had a diagnosis of any organic mental disorder, or a primary diagnosis of learning disability, an eating disorder, or drug or alcohol dependency, recruited from seven state-funded mental health services in England. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to the intervention (peer support plus care as usual) or control (care as usual) groups by an in-house, online randomisation service, stratified by site and diagnostic group (psychotic disorders, personality disorders, and other eligible non-psychotic disorders) with randomly permuted blocks of randomly varying length to conceal the allocation sequence and achieve the allocation ratio. The peer support group received manual-based, one-to-one peer support, focused on building individual strengths and engaging with activities in the community, beginning during the index admission and continuing for 4 months after discharge, plus care as usual. Care as usual consisted of follow-up by community mental health services within 7 days of discharge. The primary outcome was psychiatric readmission 12 months after discharge (number of patients readmitted at least once), analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. All patients were included in a safety analysis, excluding those who withdrew consent for use of their data. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN10043328. The trial was complete at the time of reporting.Findings Between Dec 1,2016, and Feb 8,2019,590 patients were recruited and randomly assigned, with 294 allocated to peer support (287 included in the analysis after withdrawals and loss to follow-up), and 296 to care as usual (291 in the analysis). Mean age was 39.7 years (SD 13.7; range 18-75). 306 patients were women, 267 were men, three were transgender, and two preferred not to say. 353 patients were White, 94 were Black, African, Caribbean, or Black British, 68 were Asian or Asian British, 48 were of mixed or multiple ethnic groups, and 13 were of other ethnic groups. In the peer support group, 136 (47%) of 287 patients were readmitted at least once within 12 months of discharge. 146 (50%) of 291 were readmitted in the care as usual group. The adjusted risk ratio of readmission was 0.97 (95% CI 0.82-1-14; p=0.68), and the adjusted odds ratio for readmission was 0.93 (95% CI 0.66-1-30; p=0-68). The unadjusted risk difference was 0.03 (95% CI -0.11 to 0.05; p=0.51) in favour of the peer support group. Serious adverse events were infrequent (67 events) and similar between groups (34 in the peer support group, 33 in the care as usual group). Threat to life (self-harm) was the most common serious adverse event (35152%1 of 67 serious adverse events). 391 other adverse events were reported, with self-harm (not life threatening) the most common (189 148%] of 391).Interpretation One-to-one peer support for discharge from inpatient psychiatric care, plus care as usual, was not superior to care as usual alone in the 12 months after discharge. This definitive, high-quality trial addresses uncertainty in the evidence base and suggests that peer support should not be implemented to reduce readmission post-discharge for patients at risk of readmission. Further research needs to be done to improve engagement with peer support in high-need groups, and to explore differential effects of peer support for people from different ethnic communities.

The condition mostly affects men, mainly because of sociocultural messages promoting hyper-muscular forms as ideal male figures. Relatively few studies have examined muscle dysmorphia in transgender people. Using a sample of 293 Italian adults, in this study we compared muscle dysmorphia symptoms (drive for size, appearance anxiety/avoidance and functional impairment) across 60 binary transgender (women and men whose gender identity did not conform to their biological sex), 217 cisgender (women and men whose biological sex aligns with their gender identity) and 16 non-binary people (those whose gender identity did not fall within the binary gender system). We also investigated the effect of the internalisation of body ideals on the development of muscle dysmorphia, analysing the moderating role of gender identity. Findings showed that i) transgender and cisgender men scored similarly higher on drive for size, ii) transgender men scored higher on appearance anxiety/avoidance, compared to other gender groups, iii) no differences were found in functional impairment. The effect of internalisation of body ideals on drive for size was stronger in cisgender men. Findings signal the importance of investigating risk factors for muscle dysmorphia in transgender people."

Manifest variable path analysis of the hypothesized model explained 35% and 27% of the variance in eating disorder and depressive symptoms, respectively. Results revealed a distinct pattern of cross-sectional direct and indirect relations for eating disorder and depressive symptoms. Specifically, body shame was a key unique correlate of eating disorder symptoms and linked internalization of cultural appearance standards and body surveillance with eating disorder symptoms. Appearance anxiety was a key unique correlate of depressive symptoms and linked internalization of cultural appearance standards and body surveillance with depressive symptoms. Sexual objectification experiences and interoceptive awareness generally did not yield significant unique direct or indirect relations in the model. These findings suggest distinct and complementary points of intervention to mitigate eating disorder and depressive symptoms for sexual minority women."
