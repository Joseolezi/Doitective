The purpose of this study was to examine associations between GD, ED, and mental health diagnoses among adolescents. Methods: Data were extracted from the electronic health records of 57,353 patients aged 9-18 seen at a single pediatric health system between 2009 and 2022. Adjusted logistic regression models tested for associations between GD, ED, and mental health diagnoses. Results: Youth with a GD diagnosis had significantly greater odds of also having an ED diagnosis compared to those without a GD diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.72, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.98–4.64). Among those with an ED diagnosis, youth with a GD diagnosis had significantly lower odds of having an anorexia nervosa diagnosis (aOR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.18–0.61) and significantly greater odds of having an unspecified or other specified ED diagnosis (aOR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.56–3.93) compared to those without a GD diagnosis. Youth with both GD and ED diagnoses had significantly greater odds of also having a diagnosis of anxiety (aOR = 24.01, 95% CI: 14.85–38.83), depression (aOR = 48.41, 95% CI: 30.38–77.12), suicidality (aOR = 26.15, 95% CI: 16.65–41.05) and self-harm (aOR = 35.79, 95% CI: 22.48–56.98) as compared to those with neither a GD nor an ED diagnosis. Discussion: Adolescents with co-occurring GD and ED diagnoses are at greater risk for anxiety, depression, suicidality, and self-harm as compared to youth with neither diagnosis. Further research is essential to understand the complex interplay of mental health concerns and EDs among gender diverse adolescents and to inform appropriate interventions. © 2024 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine"

S.; Axelrad, Marni E.",,"An estimated 1.8% of U.S. adolescents identify as transgender, and when using expansive language to include diverse identities along the gender continuum (e.g., nonbinary, gender fluid), rates may be notably higher. Gender-diverse youth (GDY) experience significantly elevated rates of depression, anxiety, suicidality, and eating disorders relative to the general population. Youth with autism spectrum disorders also appear to report diverse gender identities at higher rates than neurotypical youth. Gender-minoritized stress, including distal (e.g., transgender related stigma and discrimination) and proximal (e.g., social or familial rejection due to gender-diverse identity) stressors, increase risk for mental health disorders among GDY, and gender affirmation mitigates risk. Gender-affirming medical and behavioral health care is associated with enhanced resilience and positive mental health outcomes for GDY."

The purpose of this study was to examine ED psychopathology among adolescents and young adults in Canada with diverse gender and sexual identities. Method: Data were collected from 2,714 Canadians, aged 16–30 years old, via an online survey at the end of 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants responded to sociodemographic questions (including history of EDs) and reported on eating attitudes and behaviors. Descriptive statistics and multiple modified Poisson and linear regressions were conducted. Results: Over half the sample was heterosexual, 35% were sexual minority cisgender men and women, and 6.5% were transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) people. The sample overall reported elevated ED psychopathology based on their eating attitudes and behaviors. TGNC participants reported the most severe ED psychopathology. Generally, sexual minority cisgender women and cisgender men had elevated ED psychopathology compared to their heterosexual counterparts. Regression analyses revealed all gender and sexual minorities reported greater ED psychopathology compared to heterosexual cisgender men. Discussion: The Canadian sample reported elevated ED psychopathology compared to previous studies among various populations. Additional investigations are now needed to observe how ED psychopathology continues to change after the onset of the pandemic. Further research is needed among cisgender men, TGNC people, and sexual minorities to understand the unique stressors they face that lead to high ED psychopathology, and develop appropriate prevention and treatment tools. Public significance: EDs affect people of all gender and sexual identities. People who identify as a gender and/or sexual minority often experience problematic eating attitudes and behaviors, particularly transgender and gender non-conforming people of all sexual identities. More research attention is needed among these populations, especially due to a paucity of research among Canadians, to develop effective diagnostic tools, prevention efforts, and treatment programs specific to gender and sexual identities. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

Method: Participants were 25 TNB individuals and 376 cisgender individuals admitted to a HLOC ED treatment facility. Participants completed the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Beck Anxiety Inventory at admission and discharge. Results: TNB individuals showed significant improvements on EDE-Q global scores between admission and discharge (Cohen's d = 1.27), and showed similar improvements on the EDE-Q over the course of treatment (Cohen's d = 0.06) when compared to cisgender individuals.

Discussion: This study provides preliminary evidence that TNB and cisgender individuals show similar improvement in ED symptoms during HLOC treatment. However, TNB individuals have more severe depression and less improvement in depression compared to cisgender individuals, without improvement in suicidality. TNB individuals may benefit from care targeting depression and suicidality during ED treatment. Public Significance Statement: TNB individuals have increased risk of EDs.

This study examined how identity development and minority stress relate to the presence of disordered eating behaviors and cognitions in transgender and gender nonbinary individuals, and improvement at one-year follow-up. Methods: Data come from a multi-site, longitudinal study of transgender and gender nonbinary individuals (n = 287) and includes assessment of transgender congruence, receipt of gender-affirming care, minority stress, and disordered eating symptoms. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was used to test for associations between identity development, minority stress, and eating-related psychopathology. Results: Eighty-three participants (28.9%) met criteria for current eating-related psychopathology. Loss of control eating was the most commonly endorsed behavior, followed by laxative, diuretic, or other medication use, and compulsive exercise. Higher transgender congruence was associated with lower odds of disordered eating symptoms (OR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.55–0.94), whereas increased internalized transphobia was associated with greater odds of disordered eating symptoms (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.04–1.91). Participants with eating-related psychopathology had greater odds of having received gender-affirming psychotherapy in the year prior to assessment (OR = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.32–4.14). Conclusions: Results suggest that gender identity development and internalized transphobia are associated with eating-related psychopathology in transgender and gender nonbinary individuals.

Results: Eighty-three participants (28.9%) met criteria for current eating-related psychopathology. Loss of control eating was the most commonly endorsed behavior, followed by laxative, diuretic, or other medication use, and compulsive exercise. Higher transgender congruence was associated with lower odds of disordered eating symptoms (OR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.55-0.94), whereas increased internalized transphobia was associated with greater odds of disordered eating symptoms (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.04-1.91). Participants with eating-related psychopathology had greater odds of having received gender-affirming psychotherapy in the year prior to assessment (OR = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.32-4.14). Conclusions: Results suggest that gender identity development and internalized transphobia are associated with eating-related psychopathology in transgender and gender nonbinary individuals. Mental health providers should consider assessing all transgender and gender nonbinary individuals for eating-related psychopathology and unique risk factors associated with disordered eating, including low transgender congruence and internalized transphobia."

Of the GR adolescents, 40.9% had not received any psychiatric diagnosis during adolescence. Eating disorders were less common in the GR than in the MHR group, but otherwise the prevalences of disorders did not differ statistically significantly. At the symptom level, the GR adolescents displayed significantly more suicidal ideation and talk and less alcohol abuse and eating disorder symptoms than did the MHR adolescents, but otherwise their symptom profiles were comparable. Additionally, the GR adolescents had significantly fewer total externalizing symptoms than did the MHR adolescents. Ado-lescents seeking gender affirming treatments present with psychiatric symptoms and disorders comparable to those seen among adolescent psychiatric patients.

Transgender women are at greater risk of suffering heart attacks or ischemic accidents, among other diseases, and are also at greater risk of developing eating disorders, poorer weight control and poorer perception of their image. Hormone therapy for gender reaffirmation in trans women modifies their body composition, and may also increase the risk of suffering from some pathologies. The nutritional needs of cisgender women are different from those of men, and trans women also have special needs, which may depend on whether or not they follow hormone therapy. Dietary studies, although scarce, suggest that transgender women have poor dietary habits and lifestyle. It is necessary to deepen the study of the nutritional situation of the female group, considering its diversity, and to develop standards and references appropriate to each case that allow better attention to the needs of these groups.Introduccion: El colectivo femenino merece una especial atencion debido a los diferentes requerimientos que tienen en comparacion con el colectivo masculino.

Las necesidades nutricionales de las mujeres cisgenero son diferentes a las de los varones, y tambien tienen necesidades especiales las mujeres trans, que pueden depender del seguimiento o no de un tratamiento hormonal.

Transfeminine youth, especially in Asian cultures, are understudied in this context. This study investigates eating disorder risks among Thai transfeminine youth and compares to cisgender females, focusing on the association with body dissatisfaction. This study aims to explore 3 objectives: (1) to assess and compare the prevalence of eating disorder risks between Thai transfeminine youth and cisgender females; (2) to examine the link between body dissatisfaction and eating disorder risks; (3) to identify risk factors associated with abnormal eating disorder screening outcomes. Method: This is a cross-sectional comparative study conducted between September 2021 and October 2022. The study questionnaire includes Thai version of the Eating Attitude Test-26 (EAT-26) to assess the risks of eating disorders and Thai version of the Body Image Concern Inventory (BICI) to assess body dissatisfaction. The questionnaire was distributed through social media platforms to transfeminine and cisgender females, aged 12–25 years. The correlation between eating disorder risks and body dissatisfaction was analyzed with linear regression, while the comparisons between transfeminine individuals and cisgender female groups were analyzed with Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results: The study included 241 transfeminine individuals and 388 cisgender females, median age 19.0 years (interquartile range [IQR] 18–21) and 18 years (IQR 16–20), respectively. Ninety (37.3%) transfeminine individuals had an EAT-26 score ≥ 20, suggesting concerns for dieting and eating behaviors, compared to 70 (18%) cisgender females (p < 0.001). Risk factors for EDs included obesity (odds ratio [OR] 3.22, confidence interval [CI] 1.36–7.6) and low income (OR 3.66, CI 1.59–8.4). Protective factors were negligible exercise (OR 0.24, CI 0.09–0.66), gender identity disclosure (OR 0.27, CI 0.1–0.77), and high levels of happiness (OR 0.85, CI 0.73–0.98). There is a significant correlation between the positive eating behavior screening and the body dissatisfaction scores.

Transfeminine youth, especially in Asian cultures, are understudied in this context. This study investigates eating disorder risks among Thai transfeminine youth and compares to cisgender females, focusing on the association with body dissatisfaction. This study aims to explore 3 objectives: (1) to assess and compare the prevalence of eating disorder risks between Thai transfeminine youth and cisgender females; (2) to examine the link between body dissatisfaction and eating disorder risks; (3) to identify risk factors associated with abnormal eating disorder screening outcomes. Method This is a cross-sectional comparative study conducted between September 2021 and October 2022. The study questionnaire includes Thai version of the Eating Attitude Test-26 (EAT-26) to assess the risks of eating disorders and Thai version of the Body Image Concern Inventory (BICI) to assess body dissatisfaction. The questionnaire was distributed through social media platforms to transfeminine and cisgender females, aged 12-25 years. The correlation between eating disorder risks and body dissatisfaction was analyzed with linear regression, while the comparisons between transfeminine individuals and cisgender female groups were analyzed with Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results The study included 241 transfeminine individuals and 388 cisgender females, median age 19.0 years (interquartile range [IQR] 18-21) and 18 years (IQR 16-20), respectively. Ninety (37.3%) transfeminine individuals had an EAT-26 score >= 20, suggesting concerns for dieting and eating behaviors, compared to 70 (18%) cisgender females (p < 0.001). Risk factors for EDs included obesity (odds ratio [OR] 3.22, confidence interval [CI] 1.36-7.6) and low income (OR 3.66, CI 1.59-8.4). Protective factors were negligible exercise (OR 0.24, CI 0.09-0.66), gender identity disclosure (OR 0.27, CI 0.1-0.77), and high levels of happiness (OR 0.85, CI 0.73-0.98). There is a significant correlation between the positive eating behavior screening and the body dissatisfaction scores. Conclusions Transfeminine youths show significantly higher concerns about dieting, body weight, and eating behaviors than their cisgender females, highlighting the unique challenges they face. These results emphasize the needs for targeted screening, health care access for treatment and support for eating disorders in transfeminine youths."

However, very little research has examined the prevalence and correlates of cybervictimization among diverse subpopulations of youth. Data and methods Data from 13,602 adolescents aged 12 to 17 were drawn from the 2019 Canadian Health Survey on Children and Youth. Adolescents reported on their experiences of cybervictimization in the past 12 months, general mental health, and eating disorder symptoms; adolescents aged 15 to 17 reported on suicidal ideation and attempt; and parents reported on problems with depression and anxiety. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of experiencing cybervictimization according to characteristics, including gender identity, population group, same-gender attraction, low family income, and the presence of chronic conditions and digital media habits. Logistic regression models were also used to estimate the odds of experiencing each mental health difficulty by sociodemographic characteristics and experience of cybervictimization. Results The odds of experiencing cybervictimization were higher among transgender and non-binary youth, females attracted to the same gender or unsure of their attraction, and adolescents living with chronic conditions (particularly females and those living in low-income households). Cybervictimization was consistently associated with a greater risk of poor general mental health, depression or anxiety, eating disorder symptoms, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt. These associations did not differ according to the sociodemographic characteristics assessed. In terms of digital media habits, lower frequencies of use were generally associated with a lower likelihood of experiencing cybervictimization.

Methods: Employing a convergent mixed method design, we surveyed 411 individuals, and conducted qualitative semi-structured follow-up interviews with 43 LGBTQ+ -identifying survey respondents. Using OLS regression and multinomial logistic regression, we modeled eating disorder symptoms and perceived weight gain among LGBTQ+ individuals (n = 120) and cisgender and heterosexual-identifying women (n = 230), to cisgender and heterosexual-identifying men (n = 61). We also explored complementary interview narratives among LGBTQ+ people by employing selective coding strategies. Results: Study results suggest that LGBTQ+ individuals are likely experiencing uniquely high levels of pandemic-related stress, and secondly, that pandemic-related stress is associated with elevated eating disorder symptoms and higher risk of perceived weight gain. Nearly 1 in 3 participants reported eating disorder symptoms of potentially clinical significance.

Adults, particularly those identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer (LGBTQ+), may be at risk of engaging in disordered eating behaviors (eating disorder symptoms) due to pandemic-related stress. This study explores correlates of eating disorder symptoms and perceived weight gain among adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. We surveyed 411 US-residents, and engaged in follow-up semi-structured interviews with 43 LGBTQ+ -identifying survey respondents to better establish the unique pandemic-related experiences and mental health challenges of LGBTQ+ adults. We quantitatively found that LGBTQ+ individuals experienced uniquely high levels of pandemic-related stress, and secondly, that pandemic-related stress was associated with increased eating disorder symptoms and perceived weight gain. Qualitative narratives complemented quantative findings and suggested that eating concerns, physical exercise constraints, and weight concerns were important to LGBTQ+ people's perceived health challenges during the pandemic. These findings highlight the need to screen for any persistent eating disorder symptoms or weight concerns, particularly among LGBTQ+ adults."

To help fill this gap, we investigated whether cumulative exposure to state-level structural sexism from childhood through young adulthood potentiates differences in disordered eating risk between cisgender girls/women and boys/men. Methods: Participants came from the Growing Up Today Study (N = 16,875), a cohort of children aged 9–14 years in 1996 who we followed through 2016. Using a composite index of relevant state policies and social inequalities from the Institute for Women's Policy Research, we categorized states as having high or low levels of structural sexism and summed the number of years participants had lived in a high structural sexism state during the study period to quantify their cumulative exposure. We fit sequential conditional mean models to estimate the effect of cumulative exposure on risk of four outcomes (chronic dieting, purging, binge eating, and overeating), controlling for individual- and state-level confounders via propensity scores. We then tested whether effects differed between girls/women and boys/men by including cumulative-exposure-by-gender-identity interaction terms and calculating the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI). Results: In the full sample, each additional year of living in a high structural sexism state was associated with a 5% increased risk of purging (95% confidence interval (CI): 3%, 7%), an 8% increased risk of binge eating (95% CI: 6%, 10%), and a 9% increased risk of overeating (95% CI: 8%, 11%).

To assess the risk of eating disorder diagnoses across groups, we applied a Cox proportional hazards model with gender-affirming care as a time-varying covariate.ResultsHere we show that transfeminine individuals receiving hormone therapy (HT) have a significantly higher likelihood of being diagnosed with an eating disorder compared to those without intervention (HR:1.67, 95% CI:1.41, 1.98). Conversely, transmasculine individuals on HT exhibit a reduced risk of being diagnosed with an eating disorder relative to those without intervention (HR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.76, 0.90).ConclusionsAfter undergoing gender-affirming medical therapy, the risk of eating disorder diagnosis increases for transfeminine individuals and decreases for transmasculine individuals. The observed differences in risk between transfeminine and transmasculine individuals on GAMT may be attributed to factors such as gendered societal norms, variations in screening practices, and the physiological effects of hormone therapy on eating disorder symptomatology. Further research is needed to clarify these influences and support tailored interventions."

Established predictors of binge eating behavior include negative emotions and sociocultural processes; however, these studies are generally conducted in samples of young women where sexual identity is not known or reported. There is a dearth of research evaluating how sexual minority-specific factors (eg, minority stress and connectedness to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer community) may affect binge eating in sexual minority women. In addition, no studies have examined these processes in racially diverse samples or considered how intersecting minority identities (eg, Black and sexual minority) may affect eating behaviors. Objective: The Health and Experiences in Real Life (HER Life) Project aims to clarify real-world predictors of binge eating in young heterosexual and sexual minority women using ecological momentary assessment. The role of affective, social, and health behavior factors in binge eating will be examined for all women (aim 1), and sexual minority-specific predictors will also be considered for sexual minority women participants (aim 2). Person-level moderators of race, body- and eating-related factors, and sexual minority-specific factors will also be examined to better understand how real-world binge eating predictors may differ for various demographic groups (aim 3). Methods: Researchers aim to recruit 150 sexual minority and 150 heterosexual women from across the United States, including at least 50 Black women for each group, using web-based recruitment methods. The eligibility criteria include identifying as a woman, being aged between 18 and 30 years, and having had at least two binge eating episodes in the last 2 weeks.

Hormone replacement therapy in the transgender population is an underrecognized cause of elevated triglyceride (TG) levels and may put this group at a higher risk for severe pancreatitis. We present a case of AP in a genetically male patient receiving hormone therapy for female gender transformation. A 51-year-old with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with severe epigastric abdominal pain associated with nonbilious, nonbloody vomiting and anorexia for two days. The patient was diagnosed with hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis (HTG-AP) in the setting of elevated lipase levels of 2,083 u/L and TGs of 5,000 mg/dL. In addition, a computerized tomography scan of the abdomen showed pancreatitis without evidence of necrosis. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit for the management of AP in the setting of elevated TG levels. She was treated with intravenous fluids and an insulin drip. Her home medications including estradiol and Aldactone were held. Once the TG levels were reduced to <500 mg/dL, she was taken off the Insulin drip and transitioned to a subcutaneous insulin regimen along with gemfibrozil and omega-3 fatty acid over the next three days, and then discharged to home. HTG accounts for only about 7% of pancreatitis cases and increases in severity as TG levels increase. The clinical presentation of patients suffering from HTG-AP is similar to patients with AP from other etiologies and presents in a relatively younger population compared to AP from other causes. Treatment options for HTG-AP usually utilize insulin and heparin; however, plasma exchange and venovenous filtration may be used for severe cases of HTG-AP.

However, the mechanisms underlying elevated risk for ARFID in this group are currently unknown. Gender diversity and neurodivergence commonly co-occur, with elevated sensory sensitivities reported to be a shared experience common across autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and ARFID. We aimed to examine the unique contribution of sensory sensitivities, including hypo- and hyper-sensitivity, in predicting ARFID symptoms in gender diverse adults, whilst controlling for autistic and ADHD traits.MethodsGender diverse adults (N = 182; 142 assigned female at birth; M age = 28.6 years) in the UK participated in an online survey. We examined correlations between their self-reported ARFID symptoms, sensory sensitivities, autistic traits (not including sensory sensitivities), and ADHD traits whilst controlling for weight and shape concerns. We then used hierarchical multiple regression to investigate the unique contribution of sensory sensitivities to ARFID symptoms whilst controlling for the other neurodivergent traits.ResultsIn our gender diverse sample, higher levels of ARFID symptoms were associated with higher levels of sensory sensitivities, autistic traits, and ADHD traits, after controlling for weight and shape concerns. Furthermore, sensory sensitivities, specifically hyper-sensitivity, uniquely predicted levels of ARFID symptoms once we accounted for autistic and ADHD traits.ConclusionsWhen considering neurodivergence, sensory hyper-sensitivities may be particularly relevant to ARFID symptomatology in gender diverse adults. Future research should explore associations between ARFID presentations and sensory sensitivities in large samples of gender diverse adults, to enable separate analyses by gender identity."

This qualitative study explored the experiences of trans patients with ED symptoms in trans-affirming primary care, which offers clinical support for gender affirmation in the context of interpersonally gender-affirming primary care services. Twenty-two participants were recruited via social media to participate in focus groups (n = 5). Researchers utilized thematic analysis. Participants reported gender-affirming and non-affirming experiences, experienced unwelcome comments from providers regarding bodies and gender, encountered barriers to disclosing their ED symptoms, felt transition-related medical care supported recovery but did not always resolve their ED symptoms, felt they had to self-advocate, and wanted their providers to recognize them as whole people (beyond their ED and transness) who experience joy.

There was no significant association between gender dysphoria/incongruence and area level deprivation. Of the 3782 children and young people with a record of gender dysphoria/incongruence, 176 (4.7%) were prescribed puberty suppressing hormones; 302 (8.0%) were prescribed masculinising/feminising hormones; and 1994 (52.7%) had a record of anxiety, depression or self-harm. Compared with matched comparators, those experiencing gender dysphoria/incongruence had similar recorded rates of anxiety and higher rates of depression and self-harm.Conclusions Recorded prevalence of gender dysphoria/incongruence increased substantially in children and young people between 2011 and 2021, particularly in recorded females. Levels of anxiety, depression and self-harm were high, indicating an urgent need for better prevention and treatment of mental health difficulties in these patients."

To address this research gap, we compared the ability of TGE-specific factors as proposed in the gender minority stress and resilience (GMSR) model, general psychological factors contained in the tripartite influence (TI) model, and an integration of these frameworks to explain body dissatisfaction and disordered eating among TGE individuals. Regression analyses were conducted to test the models’ abilities to explain experiences reported in a survey of 93 U.S. TGE adults, including 43 transgender women respondents (46.2%) and 31 transgender men respondents (33.3%). Participants were diverse with regard to age (M = 34.19, SD = 12.02) and ethnoracial background (e.g., 29.0% Hispanic/Latinx, 17.2% Black/African American, 6.5% American Indian/Alaska Native; 5.4% multiracial). Results demonstrated both models’ abilities to explain body dissatisfaction and disordered eating independently, except for the relationship between body dissatisfaction and the thinness-oriented TI model. An integration of the models better explained body dissatisfaction and disordered eating compared to either model alone. Notably, some findings did not align with the two frameworks, suggesting existing models may not adequately describe pathways through which disordered eating emerges in TGE populations. Specifically, body dissatisfaction showed no significant relationship with disordered eating and was not well explained by the TI model, and higher gender identity pride was related to greater disordered eating symptoms.

However, knowledge gaps remain regarding the frequency and characterization of foods and calories consumed during cheat meals, and their associations with eating disorder behaviors and psychopathology. Thus, the aims of this study were to delineate engagement in cheat meals among a large, national sample of Canadian adolescents and young adults. Methods: Participants (N = 2,717) were from the Canadian Study of Adolescent Health Behaviors. Frequencies of engagement in cheat meals, and associated foods and calories consumed, in the past 12 months and 30 days were determined. The associations between engagement in cheat meals and eating disorder behaviors and psychopathology were determined using modified Poisson regression analyses. Results: Engagement in cheat meals in the past 12 months was highest among men (60.9%) compared to women (53.7%) and transgender/gender non-conforming (TGNC; 52.5%) participants. Cheat meals consisting between 1,000 and 1,499 cal were those most frequently reported among all participants. Mean number of cheat meals in the past 12 months was equivalent to > 1 per week, which was similar to engagement in the past 30 days. Finally, engagement in cheat meals in the past 12 months and 30 days was associated with patterns of eating disorder behaviors and psychopathology among all participants, including binge-eating-related behaviors. Conclusions: This study further characterized and extended knowledge of cheat meal engagement across genders, aligning with prior research by demonstrating that engagement is associated with greater eating disorder psychopathology. Plain english summary: Findings from this study add to the growing characterization of the novel behavioral phenomenon of cheat meals. Specifically, over half of adolescents and young adults across all 13 provinces and territories in Canada reported engaging in > 1 cal dense cheat meal per week, over the past 12 months. Despite the normalization and promotion of cheat meal engagement among the general public and unique fitness communities, engagement in this behavior is linked to greater eating disorder behaviors and psychopathology, including binge-eating episodes. Our findings emphasize the need for further research, public awareness, and clinical interventions aimed at addressing this potentially harmful eating behavior. © 2022, The Author(s)."

Overall and stratified adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were used to assess the association between different facets of identity (i.e., race/ethnicity, gender identity, and sexual orientation) and probable EDs.Results: Among all, in our analytic sample, 7.15% reported a probable ED. Interactions between all three identity variables were significant, and thus stratified odds ratios were evaluated. Transgender men were significantly more likely to report probable ED than cisgender male peers within the following racial/ethnic groups: non-Hispanic White (aOR: 3.33; 95% CI: 2.79, 3.96; p < .0001), non-Hispanic Black (aOR: 3.29; 95% CI: 1.72, 6.28; p = .0003), Hispanic (aOR: 2.31; 95% CI: 1.55, 3.43; p < .0001), Asian or Pacific Islander (aOR: 2.19; 95% CI: 1.45, 3.30; p = .0002), Biracial or Multicultural (aOR: 3.36; 95% CI: 2.17, 5.22; p < .0001), and other (aOR: 4.19; 95% CI: 2.25, 7.79; p < .0001).Conclusions: This study underscores the importance of increasing our understanding of interactions between marginalized identities and the ways in which minority identity informs ED risk.Public significance: The impact of multiple marginalized identities on ED outcomes is not well understood. Our study expands on previous ACHA-NCHA studies by addressing identity intersectionality, looking at more than one identity at a time (i.e., specifically race/ethnicity, gender identity, and sexual orientation). Our results contribute unique risk profiles for students who identify with multiple marginalized groups.

Results: There was considerable heterogeneity in the predicted prevalence of our ED outcomes across the strata (e.g.,.3%–18.3% for ED diagnoses).

Results: SGMs had higher prevalence of sexual abuse (OR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.71, 2.58), other trauma (e.g., verbal/physical/emotional abuse; OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.68, 2.54), and bullying (OR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.73, 2.62) histories. SGMs had higher global EDE-Q scores than CHs at admission (γ = 0.42, SE = 0.08, p <.001) but improved faster early in treatment (γ = 0.316, SE = 0.12, p =.008). By discharge, EDE-Q scores did not differ between SGMs and CHs. Discussion: Our main hypothesis of greater abuse histories among SGMs was supported and could be one explanation of their more severe ED symptoms at treatment admission compared to CHs. In addition, elevated symptom severity in SGMs at admission coincides with greater delay between ED onset and treatment initiation among SGMs—possibly a consequence of difficulties with ED recognition in SGMs by healthcare providers. We recommend increased training for providers on identifying EDs in SGMs to reduce barriers to early intervention. © 2020 The Authors.

The purpose of this study was to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of adults with ARFID seeking treatment at a tertiary care eating disorders program, and to describe the course and outcomes of treatment at three levels of care—inpatient, intensive outpatient, and outpatient individual therapy. Method: This retrospective chart review study examined the charts of 42 patients who received treatment for ARFID between April 2020 and March 2023.

Method: A total of 160 TGE adults (aged 18–30) were recruited across the United States. Participants completed a comprehensive online survey. Data were analyzed using generalized linear models and bivariate correlations. Results: Significant differences in appearance congruence among participants at different transition stages were revealed, with the group that achieved their desired transition reporting the highest appearance congruence compared to all other groups. Furthermore, gender-related motivations for weight loss were significantly lower in individuals who achieved their desired transition compared to those with no plans to transition. Discussion: Findings suggest significantly higher appearance congruence in those who achieved their desired transition compared to other groups, and individuals who attained their desired transition exhibited significantly reduced gender-related motivations for weight loss compared to those with no plans to transition. These findings underscore the potential psychological benefits associated with successful gender-affirming care, highlighting its role not only in fostering appearance congruence but also in mitigating gender-related motivations for weight loss among TGE individuals.

We aimed to descriptively characterize and investigate baseline group differences in symptom severity between LGBTQ+ and CH ED outpatients at treatment intake. Data from 60 (22.3%) LGBTQ+ and 209 (77.7%) CH ED outpatients were used to examine: (1) demographic and diagnostic differences; (2) differences in ED, depressive, and emotion dysregulation symptoms. Objectives were tested using Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact and independent samples t-tests, and analyses of covariance adjusted for age and diagnosis, respectively. Most LGBTQ+ outpatients were bisexual (55.2%), and 6.5% identified as transgender and non-binary. LGBTQ+ outpatients presented to treatment at younger ages (Mean Difference [MD] = -3.39, p =.016) and reported more severe depressive symptoms (MD = 5.73, p =.004) than CH patients, but endorsed similar ED symptom and emotion dysregulation severity. Groups did not differ in other demographic or diagnostic characteristics. LGBTQ+ individuals may develop more severe depression and similarly severe EDs at earlier ages but seek outpatient care sooner than CH peers.

Theories suggest these disparities exist due to stressors specific to belonging to a minority group; however, few studies have specifically explored differences between SM and heterosexual individuals in clinical eating disorder samples. Thus, the present study compared SM and heterosexual patients with eating disorders on demographic characteristics and eating disorder and psychological outcomes during day hospital treatment. Method Patients (N= 389) completed surveys of eating pathology, mood, anxiety, and skills use at treatment admission, 1-month post-admission, discharge, and 6-month follow-up. Overall, 19.8% of patients (n= 79) identified as SM, while 8.0% (n= 32) reported not identifying with any sexual orientation. SM were more likely to present across genders (17.7% of females, 24.2% of males, 33.3% of transgender patients, and 87.5% of nonbinary patients). Results SM patients were significantly more likely to endorse major depressive disorder, panic disorder, and self-harm at admission than their heterosexual counterparts. Multilevel models demonstrated that across time, SM patients demonstrated greater eating pathology, emotion dysregulation, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. Significant interactions between sexual orientation and time were found for eating pathology and emotion dysregulation, such that although SM patients started treatment with higher scores, they improved at a faster rate compared to heterosexual patients. Discussion Consistent with minority stress theory, SM patients report greater overall eating disorder and comorbid symptoms. Importantly, results do not support that there appear to be significant disparities in treatment outcome for SM patients in this sample of day hospital patients."

The sample included 3299 adults who screened positive for ARFID using two validated scales. SI over the past two weeks was assessed using item 9 from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The overall prevalence of SI was 22.9 %, with a higher prevalence among transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) individuals (34.7 %) compared to cisgender men (17.8 %) and cisgender women (16.8 %). Participants with SI (mean = 27.6 years, SD = 10.1) were younger than those without SI (mean = 32.3 years, SD = 13.4). The ARFID dimensions picky eating/sensory-based avoidance and low appetite/lack of interest in eating or food were positively associated with SI; however, these associations became non-significant after adjusting for age, gender, and depression. Interestingly, fear/concern about aversive consequences was significantly negatively associated with SI after adjusting for covariates. Our results suggest that the fear presentation of ARFID may be a distinct subtype with a lower risk of suicidality compared to other presentations, highlighting the importance of comprehensively evaluating ARFID dimensions and underlying depressive symptoms to better address the risk of suicidality."

Minoritised adolescents might be at higher risk of disordered eating due to minority stress, but most research has focused on White, heterosexual, cisgender individuals; less is known about disordered eating among minoritised adolescents. We examined sexual, gender, racial, and ethnic identities in relation to disordered eating in early adolescence. Method: Using 2-year follow-up data from adolescents ages 10–14 in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (N = 9385), we examined associations between sexual, gender, racial, and ethnic identities and past-2 week disordered eating (preoccupation with weight, weight control behaviors, and binge eating). Results: Compared to heterosexual peers, gay/bisexual adolescents had higher odds of all three outcomes (AOR 1.90–3.32); those “questioning” their sexual identity had higher odds of preoccupation with weight (AOR 1.82) and binge eating (AOR 2.53). Compared to cisgender adolescents, transgender adolescents had higher odds of binge eating (AOR 2.62); those “questioning” their gender identity had higher odds of preoccupation with weight (AOR 2.45). Adolescents whose racial identity was categorised as “Another” had higher odds of preoccupation with weight (AOR 1.46) and weight control behaviors (AOR 1.58) compared to White adolescents. Finally, Hispanic adolescents had higher odds of all disordered eating outcomes than non-Hispanic adolescents (AOR 1.25–1.59).

Both gender identity and sexual orientation have been identified as relevant social positions in the development of DEBs. Most existing studies have been unable to examine the intersection of these identities due to limitations in sample size. The present study assessed DEB disparities at the intersection of gender identity and sexual orientation among a large sample of sexual and gender minority adolescents. The sample included n = 9,876 adolescents. Past-year prevalence of dietary restriction, self-induced vomiting, binge eating, and diet pill use was assessed. Data were analyzed with multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy, which assumes individuals within a given subgroup are exposed to similar structural processes like heterosexism that lead to disparities. Pansexual transgender boys were among the three highest prevalence groups for multiple DEBs: Restricting prevalence was 67.1%, vomiting prevalence was 29.1%, and binge eating prevalence was 45.5%. For all outcomes, at least one subgroup had unexpectedly high prevalence; for all outcomes except use of diet pills, at least one subgroup had unexpectedly low prevalence, indicative of interactive intersectional effects. Overall, results demonstrate that DEBs do not universally vary across either gender identity or sexual orientation. Instead, patterns are more complex as marginalized and privileged identities are not associated with only risk or only resiliency. More research is needed on the factors that drive the development of DEBs."

Peer support for discharge has been suggested as an approach to reducing readmission post-discharge. Implementation has been called for in policy, however, evidence of effectiveness from large rigorous trials is missing. We aimed to establish whether peer support for discharge reduces readmissions in the year post-discharge. Methods: We report a parallel, two-group, individually randomised, controlled superiority trial, with trial personnel masked to allocation. Patients were adult psychiatric inpatients (age ≥18 years) with at least one previous admission in the preceding 2 years, excluding those who had a diagnosis of any organic mental disorder, or a primary diagnosis of learning disability, an eating disorder, or drug or alcohol dependency, recruited from seven state-funded mental health services in England. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to the intervention (peer support plus care as usual) or control (care as usual) groups by an in-house, online randomisation service, stratified by site and diagnostic group (psychotic disorders, personality disorders, and other eligible non-psychotic disorders) with randomly permuted blocks of randomly varying length to conceal the allocation sequence and achieve the allocation ratio. The peer support group received manual-based, one-to-one peer support, focused on building individual strengths and engaging with activities in the community, beginning during the index admission and continuing for 4 months after discharge, plus care as usual. Care as usual consisted of follow-up by community mental health services within 7 days of discharge. The primary outcome was psychiatric readmission 12 months after discharge (number of patients readmitted at least once), analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. All patients were included in a safety analysis, excluding those who withdrew consent for use of their data. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN10043328. The trial was complete at the time of reporting. Findings: Between Dec 1, 2016, and Feb 8, 2019, 590 patients were recruited and randomly assigned, with 294 allocated to peer support (287 included in the analysis after withdrawals and loss to follow-up), and 296 to care as usual (291 in the analysis). Mean age was 39·7 years (SD 13·7; range 18–75). 306 patients were women, 267 were men, three were transgender, and two preferred not to say. 353 patients were White, 94 were Black, African, Caribbean, or Black British, 68 were Asian or Asian British, 48 were of mixed or multiple ethnic groups, and 13 were of other ethnic groups. In the peer support group, 136 (47%) of 287 patients were readmitted at least once within 12 months of discharge. 146 (50%) of 291 were readmitted in the care as usual group. The adjusted risk ratio of readmission was 0·97 (95% CI 0·82–1·14; p=0·68), and the adjusted odds ratio for readmission was 0·93 (95% CI 0·66–1·30; p=0·68). The unadjusted risk difference was 0·03 (95% CI –0·11 to 0·05; p=0·51) in favour of the peer support group. Serious adverse events were infrequent (67 events) and similar between groups (34 in the peer support group, 33 in the care as usual group). Threat to life (self-harm) was the most common serious adverse event (35 [52%] of 67 serious adverse events). 391 other adverse events were reported, with self-harm (not life threatening) the most common (189 [48%] of 391). Interpretation: One-to-one peer support for discharge from inpatient psychiatric care, plus care as usual, was not superior to care as usual alone in the 12 months after discharge. This definitive, high-quality trial addresses uncertainty in the evidence base and suggests that peer support should not be implemented to reduce readmission post-discharge for patients at risk of readmission. Further research needs to be done to improve engagement with peer support in high-need groups, and to explore differential effects of peer support for people from different ethnic communities.

With a sample of 200 Chinese transgender adults, the present study tested the associations and potential mechanisms between internalized cisgenderism, self-objectification, body shame, and mental health correlates in the framework of the Pantheoretical Model of Dehumanization. Correlation and regression analyses were used. Results showed that internalized cisgenderism was posi-tively related to body shame, psychological distress, disordered eating, non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts. Body shame showed significant indirect effects in the association between internalized cisgenderism and suicide attempts, and in the associations between internalized cisgenderism and psychological distress, disordered eating, and NSSI. In addition, body shame had sig-nificant indirect effects in the associations between body surveillance and disordered eating, NSSI, and suicide attempts, and in the association between body surveillance and psychological distress. As the first study testing the associations of core variables in the Pantheoretical Model of Dehumanization in a Chinese transgender sample, the findings largely supported the model in describing meaningful variance in Chinese transgender adults' psychological distress, disordered eating, and self-injurious thoughts and behaviors.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

There is a critical need to improve the understanding and prediction of suicide attempts in this vulnerable population. In this study, a primarily qualitative design was employed, supported by descriptive quantitative elements, such as code frequencies and word clouds, to explore in-depth narrative interviews of adolescents who attempted suicide. Thematic content analysis was utilized to analyze the transcripts of these narrative interviews. The study sample consisted of 22 adolescents (Mage = 16.98 years; SD = 1.624; 77% males, 19% females, 4% non-binary or transgender). The content analysis revealed two significant body-related risk factors for suicide attempts: experiences of violence or trauma and body dissatisfaction, which were associated with maladaptive coping strategies, including self-harm, substance use, and eating disorders. Acute somatic warning signs such as dissociative states, loss of control, and disconnection from one’s body suggested pronounced psychophysiological dysregulation.

There is a critical need to improve the understanding and prediction of suicide attempts in this vulnerable population. In this study, a primarily qualitative design was employed, supported by descriptive quantitative elements, such as code frequencies and word clouds, to explore in-depth narrative interviews of adolescents who attempted suicide. Thematic content analysis was utilized to analyze the transcripts of these narrative interviews. The study sample consisted of 22 adolescents (Mage = 16.98 years; SD = 1.624; 77% males, 19% females, 4% non-binary or transgender). The content analysis revealed two significant body-related risk factors for suicide attempts: experiences of violence or trauma and body dissatisfaction, which were associated with maladaptive coping strategies, including self-harm, substance use, and eating disorders. Acute somatic warning signs such as dissociative states, loss of control, and disconnection from one's body suggested pronounced psychophysiological dysregulation. The findings underscore the body as a battleground, where emotional pain related to bodily experiences and perceptions manifests significantly. Future research should integrate subjective body-related experiences in risk assessments and interventions targeting adolescent suicidal behaviors."

This research builds on prior data exploring the positive effects of tattooing and investigates how tattoos impact one's relationship to eating disorder (ED) recovery and body image. We held three focus groups lasting 60 minutes each, recruiting participants via purposive snowball sampling (n = 15), with additional opportunities to respond to focus group prompts asynchronously. Eligible participants were individuals with lived experience of an ED, self-identified as being in recovery, had three or more tattoos, and spoke English. Participants predominantly held gender-expansive (n = 4 Non-Binary, n = 3 Genderqueer, n = 3 Cisgender Women, n = 3 Transgender, n = 2 Transmasculine, n = 2 Gender Non-Conforming, n = 2 Intersex, n = 1 Cisgender Man) and non-heterosexual identities. Focus groups were held between April 2021 and July 2023 and followed a semi-structured interview format. Primary analyses focused on participants' responses to open-ended prompts regarding how they understood the relationships between tattooing, body image, and ED recovery. Thematic analysis identified four core themes: Tattooing allowing for embodiment, tattooing allowing for recovery-oriented behaviors, tattooing enabling positive body image, and tattooing facilitating empowerment. An overarching message was that tattooing is a therapeutic and transformative process, allowing for self-determination. Participants indicated that tattooing can be experienced as a powerful mechanism for behavioral change and shifts in relationship to one's body. Participants expressed that tattooing can be an effective route towards both gender euphoria and body liberation, enhancing one's ability to maintain ED recovery."

The current study assessed stigma experiences from peers at school, self-esteem, LGBTQ pride, and overlapping social positions as they relate to disordered eating behaviors among LGBTQ adolescents.MethodParticipants included 11,083 adolescents (Mage = 15.6, SD = 1.3; 34.8% transgender/gender diverse) from a large national survey study of LGBTQ adolescents from 2017. Exhaustive Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detection analysis was used to identify bias-based bullying experiences (i.e., weight-based, identity-based), self-esteem, LGBTQ pride, and overlapping social positions (i.e., gender identity, sexual identity, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI) percentile) associated with the highest prevalence of unhealthy weight control behaviors, extreme unhealthy weight control behaviors, and past year binge eating.ResultsAdolescents in the 28 identified groups with a high prevalence of disordered eating behavior held at least one structurally marginalized social position (e.g., high BMI), bias-based bullying experience, low self-esteem, or low LGBTQ pride in addition to being LGBTQ. Weight-based bullying was a salient risk-factor for disordered eating across social positions. Among adolescents with the same social positions, levels of self-esteem, LGBTQ pride, but no bias-based bullying experience, prevalence estimates of disordered eating were, on average, 23% lower.DiscussionLGBTQ adolescents with multiple marginalized social positions and related factors engage in disproportionately high prevalence disordered eating. Findings underscore the importance of addressing intersecting experiences of stigma to reduce disordered eating and promote health equity among adolescents.Public significanceMultiply marginalized LGBTQ adolescents, most of whom also reported experiencing bias-based bullying from peers at school, reported disproportionately high prevalence disordered eating. In comparison groups of adolescents with no bias-based bullying experience, prevalence of disordered eating was, on average, 24% lower.

This study examined whether LGBTQ+ status moderated the relation between negative healthcare experiences and DEBs in undergraduates. Undergraduates (n = 322) from a Southeastern (United States) university completed measures of healthcare discrimination, trust in physicians, and DEBs. Analyses investigated whether LGBTQ+ status moderated the relation between healthcare discrimination and DEBs; trust in physicians and DEBs. LGBTQ+ individuals (35% of sample), reported less trust in physicians (p < .001), and more body dissatisfaction (p = .007) and shape/weight overvaluation (p = .008). Among all undergraduates, experiences of healthcare discrimination were associated with higher body dissatisfaction (p = .003) and shape/weight overvaluation (p = .008). Less trust in physicians was associated with greater shape/weight overvaluation (p = .005). LGBTQ+ status did not moderate either relation. It is important to reduce healthcare discrimination and foster patient-provider trust for all young adults. Future research should examine factors influencing patient-provider trust among LGBTQ+ individuals."

This study aimed to (1) assess the measurement invariance of a short DE scale among high school students in Canada, and (2) estimate differences in scale scores across student sociodemographic subgroups.MethodsWe used student-level survey data collected during the 2021/2022 school year in the COMPASS study. The sample included 24,639 students in grades 9-12 from 69 secondary schools in Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario, Canada. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis was applied to assess measurement invariance (i.e., configural, metric, scalar, and strict invariance) of the 6-item DE scale, and one-way ANOVA and mixed linear regression were implemented to estimate scale score differences across population subgroups (by grade, gender, race and ethnicity, family affluence, and weight status).ResultsResults demonstrated full measurement invariance of the DE scale across student sociodemographic subgroups. Higher sum scale scores indicated greater engagement in DE thoughts or behaviours. Students in higher school grade (e.g., grade 12), transgender and gender diverse youth, and cisgender girls reported higher DE scores compared to their grade 9 and cisgender boy peers. Elevated DE scores were also observed among adolescents of Middle Eastern and Another or Multiethnic identity, students with less affluent households, and those with higher body weights, relative to their White, more affluent, and relatively lower weight peers, respectively.ConclusionsResults indicate the DE scale measures the same construct across various subgroups of adolescents, providing confidence that differences in scale scores found by grade, gender, race and ethnicity, affluence, and weight reflect actual differences in DE rather than artifactual differences in scale interpretation. This scale warrants additional psychometric testing as a promising brief DE measure suitable for large population-level youth surveys. Our results provide important new evidence from a large contemporary sample of adolescents demonstrating elevated risk of DE among specific subgroups and emphasizing the need for targeted interventions."

Despite evidence from cisgender samples linking sexual assault exposure to body image concerns and disordered eating behaviors, such as weight and shape control behaviors (WSCBs), little is known about these relationships in TNB people. The purpose of this study was to assess associations among past-year sexual assault exposure, body areas satisfaction, body weight esteem, and high-risk WSCBs in a sample of TNB young adults.Methods: A sample of 714 participants completed a cross-sectional online survey. Multivariable linear and logistic models were fit to determine associations between constructs of interest. Natural effects mediation analyses assessed for potential mediation of the relationship between sexual assault and WSCBs by body areas satisfaction and body weight esteem. Analyses were stratified by three gender identity categories.Results: Past-year sexual assault exposure was associated with significantly decreased body areas satisfaction, but only for nonbinary participants. No significant association was found between sexual assault and body weight esteem. Sexual assault was associated with significantly increased risk for WSCBs across gender identity categories. No mediation of these relationships by body areas satisfaction and body weight esteem was observed.Conclusion: Findings support clinical consideration of WSCBs in TNB survivors of sexual assault. Results suggest that multiple factors, including body image and sexual assault, may contribute separately to disordered eating behaviors in TNB young adults."

Gender-diverse individuals from non-Western cultural contexts (e.g., China) are at potentially high risk for WBI. Yet, no research has examined WBI and associated negative health consequences in this historically underrepresented population. Method: A cross-sectional, online survey sampled Chinese gender-diverse individuals (N = 410, M-age = 22.33 years). Variables were self-reported, including demographics, WBI, body shame, body dissatisfaction, disordered eating, physical and mental health status, and gender minority stress (e.g., internalized cisgenderism). Analyses included correlations and multiple hierarchical regressions. Results: Pearson bivariate correlations demonstrated associations between higher WBI and more eating and body image disturbances and poor physical and mental health. After adjusting for age, BMI, gender identity, and gender minority stress, higher WBI was uniquely and positively associated with higher body shame, higher body dissatisfaction, higher disordered eating, and poor physical and mental health. Notably, WBI accounted for more unique variance in eating and body image disturbances (13%-25% explained by WBI) than physical and mental health (1%-4% explained by WBI). Discussion: While replication with longitudinal and experimental designs is needed to speak to the temporal dynamics and causality, our findings identify WBI as a unique, meaningful correlate of eating and body image disturbances in Chinese gender-diverse adults."

Semi-structured one-on-one interviews were conducted with 13 gender non-binary individuals living in Australia. Photo elicitation techniques were utilised, and the transcribed interview data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Six themes were identified: Expansive Understandings of Body Image, Body Image can be Linked to Gender Dysphoria, Cultivating a Preferred Body can Lead to Gender Euphoria, Appreciating Diversity in Non-Binary Body Ideals, The Androgynous Body Ideal is not Universally Accepted, and Experiencing the Body as Functional rather than Aesthetic. The present findings highlight the diversity of experiences of body image for non-binary people. The non-binary concept of body image was found to be expansive, stressing various physical attributes involved in social gender recognition and physiological sources of gender dysphoria. Some participants valued gender-affirming medical intervention, others were accepting of their bodies as they are, attributing their body confidence to the process of affirming their non-binary gender."

Eligible adolescents received the Gender Identity/GD Questionnaire for Adolescents and Adults (GIDYQ-AA), a validated instrument measuring gender diversity and GD. Gender identities, sexual orientations, questionnaire scores, and frequency of GD (GIDYQ-AA score <3) were determined. The relationship of GIDYQ-AA scores and BMI Z-score (BMIz) was assessed. Of 72 consenting youth, 29 assigned females (AF) and 17 assigned males (AM) completed GIDYQ-AA and demographic questions. Seventeen (59%) AF reported non-heterosexual orientations, and 6 (21%) reported non-cisgender identities. One (6%) AM reported non-cisgender identity. Two (4%) AF individuals had GD based on GIDYQ-AA scores. GIDYQ-AA scores did not correlate with BMIz. In conclusion, adolescents with obesity, particularly AF with non-heterosexual orientation, reported high rates of non-cisgender identity and GD.

We assessed mental health problems among Finnish youth before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic using nationwide population-based samples. Our aim was to examine in which direction the heightened levels of adolescent mental health problems have developed after the pandemic. Methods In this national, repeated cross-sectional, population-based study in Finland, we recruited students at lower and upper secondary level (aged 13-20 years) who were taking part in the Finnish School Health Promotion (SHP) survey in 2015-23 (119 681-158 897 participants per round). The SHP is based on total sampling and conducted biennially between March and May. Self-reports covered the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale; the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire for depression; the Mini Social Phobia Inventory for social anxiety; the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale for mental wellbeing; loneliness; the Sick, Control, One Stone, Fat, Food measure for disordered eating; and suicidality (suicidal ideation, deliberate self-harm, and suicide attempts). Scales were dichotomised using validated cutoffs. Presence of any and comorbid mental health problems was assessed. Logistic (for dichotomised outcomes) and linear (for Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale) mixed effects models were used to analyse the effect of survey year on mental health, controlling for sociodemographic background factors and stratified by gender and school level. Cisgender and transgender youth were compared. Findings Between 2015 and 2023, the SHP study recruited 722 488 students (371 634 [516%] girls and 348 857 [484%] boys) with a mean age of 158 years (SD 13) who were either in the eighth and ninth grades of comprehensive school or the first and second years of general and vocational upper secondary schools in Finland. The proportion of participants with generalised anxiety, depression, and social anxiety symptoms above the cutoff increased from preCOVID-19 levels to 2021 and remained at these higher levels in 2023 among all study groups. Among girls in lower secondary education, prevalence of generalised anxiety, depression, and social anxiety symptoms increased from 2021 to 2023, as did social anxiety among girls in upper secondary education. Among boys, the proportion with social anxiety symptoms decreased between 2021 and 2023. Mental wellbeing scores decreased in all groups between 2021 and 2023, and disordered eating increased in girls, and in boys in lower secondary education. Suicidality increased in girls but not in boys. Loneliness was the only measure to show improvement in all groups from 2021 to 2023. In 2023, 55 895 (726%) of 76 994 girls and 22 718 (328%) of 69 205 boys reported at least one mental health problem, and 37 250 (484%) girls and 9442 (136%) boys reported comorbid mental health problems. Among both transfeminine and transmasculine youth, the prevalence of generalised anxiety and depression symptoms decreased from 2021 to 2023, but compared with cisgender youth, the proportions were significantly higher throughout. Interpretation The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth mental health could be long lasting. In this study, the substantial change for the better among transgender youth was a positive exception.Providing adequate support and treatment for young people with poor mental health is essential, but solutions to the mental health crisis need to address a wider societal perspective and should be developed in partnership with young people.

Following synchronous and asynchronous training, the protocol was implemented in a virtual ED treatment setting with a national reach serving patients ages 6-24 years. This paper offers a summary of best practices and approaches for providing GAC in ED treatment settings. The use of GAC practices has the potential to address underlying issues and inequities in treatment delivery and outcomes. We encourage ED treatment providers to consider the adoption/adaptation of GAC best practices to more effectively meet the needs of TGE patients. More research is needed to better understand the influence of individual and collective GAC practices on specific ED treatment outcomes."

Frequencies were used to determine the prevalence of 11 different diets among the sample, and chi-square tests were used to assess gender differences. Multiple modified Poisson and linear regression analyses were conducted to determine the associations between any dieting and eating disorder attitudes and behaviors. Among the sample, 15.7 % of girls and women, 10.4 % of boys and men, and 13.0 % of transgender/gender expansive (TGE) participants reported any dieting in the past 12 months, with the Ketogenic diet being most common among all genders. Results from regression analyses showed that engaging in any dieting in the past 12 months was associated with greater eating disorder psychopathology among girls, women, boys, and men, but not TGE participants. There were varying trends in association between specific types of dieting practices and eating disorder behaviors among girls, women, boys, and men. Dieting is relatively common among a national sample of Canadian adolescents and young adults, and engagement is associated with greater eating disorder psychopathology and behaviors. Healthcare and public health professionals should consider screening for eating disorders among adolescents and young adults who report engaging in dieting practices."

However, Canadians experience food inse-curity as well, which may have been heightened by the pandemic and its associated restrictions. The associations between food insecurity and ED psychopathology among Canadians remains underexamined. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore associations between food insecurity and ED psychopathology by gender identity among a national sample Canadian adolescents and young adults. Data were collected from 2714 par-ticipants aged 16 to 30 years old from across Canada. Participants reported sociodemographic characteristics, ED psychopathology, and food insecurity experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic through an online survey. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, ANOVAs, and regression analyses were conducted. Overall, 8.9% of the sample experienced food insecurity, with the highest prevalence among transgender and gender nonconforming individuals. Generally, those with no food insecurity reported the lowest ED psychopathology compared to higher ED psychopathology among those with food insecurity. Several unique differences were observed between cisgender men and cisgender women, while there were no significant associations between food insecurity and ED psychopathology found among transgender and gender nonconforming individuals. Further research is needed to investigate how the relationship between food insecurity and ED psychopathology differs based on gender, and to continue to explore food insecurity experienced beyond the COVID-19 pandemic as food inse-curity possesses a considerable health threat to all."

Research suggests that LBW are vulnerable to both traditional risk factors for binge eating found in general samples of women (e.g., emotion dysregulation) and risk factors specific to their sexual minority identity (e.g., experiences of heterosexist discrimination). This study tested a within-person model of binge eating in a sample of 233 young adult cisgender LBW. The model was based on the psychological mediation framework. Participants completed online surveys assessing binge eating, internalized stigma, depressive symptoms, and experiences with heterosexist discrimination every evening for a period of 9 days. Data were analyzed using dynamic structural equation modeling. Approximately 22.3% of participants reported at least one binge eating episode during the study period. Results provided partial support for the psychological mediation framework. Same-day discrimination, but not previous-day discrimination, indirectly predicted binge eating through the mediator of depressive symptoms. Internalized stigma was unrelated to binge eating. Body appreciation moderated the within-person association between depressive symptoms and binge eating, such that women with higher levels of body appreciation exhibited a weaker association between these variables. Sexual orientation and sense of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer community membership did not moderate the associations between discrimination, internalized stigma, or depressive symptoms and binge eating. Results reveal the importance of investigating the complex relations between general psychological and sexual minority-specific risk factors when attempting to understand elevated rates of psychopathology among sexual minority populations."

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between gender identity, gender affirming interventions such as gender affirming hormones (GAH) and gender affirming surgeries (GAS), and ED symptomatology.Method Transgender patients at a primary care outpatient gender health program in the United States completed a survey consisting of demographics, medical history, and clinical variables, including the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q). Multivariate analyses of covariance were conducted to compare EDE-Q scores across gender identity and gender affirmation.Results Compared to transgender men (n = 79), transgender women (n = 87) reported higher EDE-Q scores and significantly higher Eating Concern. Compared to hormone/surgery-naive and hormone-experienced/surgery-naive patients, hormone/surgery-experienced patients had lower EDE-Q scores. Hormone/surgery-experienced patients reported significantly lower Shape Concern and marginally lower Global Score and Weight Concern than hormone-experienced/surgery-naive patients. There were no differences in EDE-Q scores between hormone/surgery-naive and hormone-experienced/surgery-naive patients.Discussion Transgender patients report high levels of ED symptomatology. There are subtle, yet important, differences in ED between gender identities and gender affirmations. High ED prevalence may result from the dual pathways of sociocultural pressures as well as gender dysphoria. Both GAH and GAS may be effective interventions to support gender affirmation and thereby alleviate ED symptomatology. While the potential positive benefits of GAS on ED are more apparent, the effects of GAH are less clear."

Data were collected from 249 treatment-seeking TG youth, Ages 11-24. Results indicate that one general eating disorder factor was a tenable solution for all items on the EDE-Q for both TG women, TG men, and the combined sample. Also, no mean difference was found between TG women and TG men on the total EDE-Q. Results suggested the performance of the EDE-Q in a sample of treatmentseeking TG youth are similar to those observed in previously published cisgender female samples. Because the findings from this study demonstrated that a total score for the EDE-Q is better used among treatment-seeking TG youth, it is tentatively recommended to not consider subscale scores, but replications are needed. Our findings highlight the importance of this area of study for both researchers and clinicians, because of the dearth of information about the EDE-Q when used with treatment-seeking TG youth. A critical next step is to consider whether the EDE-Q is measuring salient experiences and diagnostic classifications related to eating disorders in treatment-seeking TG youth."

Participants included 3,371 adult students from 78 campuses who identified as transgender or nonbinary (TNB) and completed the 2017-2018 or 2018-2019 waves of the cross-sectional multi-institute Healthy Minds Study. Via an online survey, participants completed validated measures assessing perceptual and cognitive-affective body image constructs, positive mental health, and eating disorder pathology. A structural equation model examined whether weight misperception (over- and underperception) and thin-ideal overvaluation were associated with positive mental health and, in turn, eating disorder pathology. Whether these associations differed among individuals who identified as trans men, trans women, and genderqueer/gender nonconforming and individuals with self-identified TNB identities was examined via a multiple-group structural equation model. Overall, 35% of participants exhibited elevated eating disorder pathology. Overvaluation of the thin ideal and weight overperception, but not weight underperception, were associated with lower levels of positive mental health, which in turn was associated with elevated eating disorder pathology. These associations did not differ across the assessed TNB identity groups. These findings support the continued use of a positive psychological perspective in research seeking to explain the elevated risk for eating disorder pathology found among individuals with TNB identities. Screening individuals comprising these historically overlooked groups for the presence of weight overperception and thin-ideal overvaluation via brief screening forms during routine health care visits is recommended.Public Significance Statement In one of the largest studies of transgender and nonbinary young adults to date, weight overperception and thin-ideal overvaluation were associated with less positive mental health and, in turn, elevated eating disorder pathology. Prevention programs designed to enhance the positive mental health of this population warrant further assessment."

Methods From the 2018 IBM (R) MarketScan (R) Commercial Database, there were 10,415 people identifiable as transgender based on International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) codes and procedure codes, specific to gender-affirming care, from inpatient and outpatient claims. Eating disorders were identified from ICD-10 codes and included anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, eating disorder not otherwise specified, avoidant restrictive feeding and intake disorder, and other specified feeding and eating disorders. We estimated the prevalence of specific eating disorders diagnoses by selecting patient characteristics. Results Of individuals receiving some form of gender-affirming care, 2.43% (95% confidence interval: 2.14%-2.74%) were diagnosed with an eating disorder: 0.84% anorexia nervosa, 0.36% bulimia nervosa, 0.36% binge eating disorder, 0.15% avoidant restrictive feeding and intake disorder, 0.41% other specified feeding and eating disorders, and 1.37% with an unspecified eating disorder. Among transgender-identifiable patients aged 12-15 years, 5.60% had an eating disorder diagnosis, whereas 0.52% had an eating disorder diagnosis in patients aged 45-64 years. Discussion In patients identifiable as transgender, with receipt of gender-affirming care, the prevalence of diagnosed eating disorders was low compared to extant self-reported data for eating disorder diagnosis in transgender individuals. Among this population, eating disorders were highest in adolescents and young adults. Clinically verified prevalence estimates for eating disorder diagnosis in transgender people with a history of gender-affirming care warrant further investigation. Public Significance The present study aims to provide clinically validated, contemporary prevalence estimates for diagnosed eating disorders among a medically affirmed population of transgender adults and children in the United States. We report low prevalence of having any eating disorder relative to prevalence estimates reported in prior literature without clinical validation. These findings may be explained by access to affirming care and medical care generally."

We asked gender-expansive participants in The PRIDE Study to fill out a widely used survey about muscle dysmorphia (when someone is worried about not being muscular enough). We found that this issue about muscularity has three parts for gender-expansive people: (1) a desire to be bigger and more muscular, (2) dissatisfaction with the way their body looks, and (3) problems with normal life functions. We find that this survey is appropriate for use in gender-expansive people. These results can help providers and researchers understand the muscle-related problems that gender-expansive people face.Purpose Muscle dysmorphia is generally classified as a specific form of body dysmorphic disorder characterized by a pathological drive for muscularity and the preoccupation that one is too small or not sufficiently muscular. The majority of research on the condition has been conducted in cisgender men with a paucity of literature on gender minority people, a population that is at risk for muscle dysmorphia. One of the most widely used measures of muscle dysmorphia symptoms, the Muscle Dysmorphic Disorder Inventory (MDDI), has not been psychometrically validated for use in gender minority samples, the aim of the present study. Methods We evaluated the psychometric properties of the MDDI in a sample of 1031 gender-expansive individuals (gender minority people whose gender identity differs from that assumed for their sex assigned at birth and is not exclusively binary man or woman) aged 18-74 who were part of The PRIDE Study, a large-scale, U.S., longitudinal cohort study. Results Using a two-step, split-sample exploratory and confirmatory factor analytic approach, we found support for the original three-factor structure of the measure. The subscales showed adequate internal consistency, and convergent validity was supported based on significant associations of the MDDI subscale scores with theoretically related scores on a widely used measure of disordered eating. Conclusions These findings provided novel support for adequate psychometric properties of the MDDI in a sample of gender-expansive individuals, facilitating the use of this measure in future research on muscle dysmorphia in this understudied and at-risk population."

Paz",,"Conceptualizations of eating disorders (ED) have primarily been based on the experiences of cisgender women. Yet trans and nonbinary individuals (TNB) may be at greater risk than cisgender individuals to suffer from eating disorders, disordered eating, and body image concerns. The current study takes a phenomenological approach to explore how TNB individuals conceptualize eating and/or body image issues. Qualitative data were obtained from 82 TNB participants who self-reported eating and/or body image concerns. Primary analyses focused on participants' responses to an open-ended prompt regarding how participants understand the relationships among gender identity, gender expression, and weight and shape control behaviors. Thematic analysis identified five themes: (a) gender dysphoria, (b) puberty, (c) emotion (dys)regulation, (d) gender expression, and (e) recovery/transition. Results indicate various factors salient to gender identity and expression and eating concerns. Findings extend beyond the traditional focus on gender dysphoria by highlighting other important factors for TNB individuals, such as the function ED psychopathology serves (e.g., gender avoidance and self-punishment). This broadens the ED field's understanding of how gender dysphoria relates to ED psychopathology, rather than focusing solely on the physical body. Distress and associated behaviors related to both gender dysphoria and eating disorder psychopathology may be reciprocal and reinforcing and, as such, should be considered in tandem in treating TNB clients experiencing EDs and body image concerns. This work may better identify ED risk and maintenance within this population and thus optimize prevention and intervention.Public Significance Statement This study describes transgender and nonbinary individuals' understandings of their eating and body image concerns. Authors identified the following themes: gender dysphoria, puberty, emotion regulation, gender expression, and recovery/transition. The current study highlights the importance of exploring gender-specific factors to conceptualize risk of, and recovery from, eating and body image issues for trans and nonbinary individuals."

Simultaneously, individuals with eating disorders reported increasing symptomology (Termorshuizen et al. in Int J Eat Disord. 53(11):1780-90, 2020). This study compares Emergency Department utilization at a pediatric quaternary-level care center by patients with eating disorders during the pandemic (March-Dec 2020) vs March-Dec 2019. We hypothesize that there was an increase in presentation of patients with eating disorders. An Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside query of the electronic medical record system identified patients with eating disorder diagnoses per ICD9/ICD10 codes aged 6-23 who presented to the Emergency Department between March 1s t and December 31s t of 2020 and 2019. Subsequent retrospective chart review was carried out. Patients were excluded from analysis if the presenting problem was not directly related to the eating disorder. During March-Dec 2019, 0.581% percent of all patients presented to the Emergency Department due to an eating disorder. During the same time frame in 2020, however, that percentage increased to 1.265%. Statistical significance was corrected using a Benjamini- Hochberg analysis. Despite a 66.5% decline in overall visits to the Emergency Department, the percentage of patients presenting with eating disorders doubled during the pandemic. During the pandemic, the total time spent awaiting placement significantly increased, and the number of patients identifying as transgender and/or nonbinary increased. Our data support the hypothesis that eating disorder presentation increased during the pandemic."

Examining ED pathology both across binary and minority gender groups, and relative to racial/ethnic identification is necessary to inform screening and culturally-sensitive intervention efforts. This study investigated patterns of ED symptomology among youth and adults (N = 13658) who telephoned treatment centers in the United States when seeking clinical support for ED symptoms. Analyses examined data from participants who completed a semi-structured clinical interview. Results indicated that Anorexia nervosa was the most common diagnosis in each gender category and for a majority of race/ethnic groups; Black individuals had elevated rates of binge eating disorder. Compared to females, males were less likely to endorse all ED symptoms (ps < .001); gender minority status was also associated with decreased report of a majority of ED symptoms. Asian and Black individuals were less likely than Whites to endorse most ED symptoms. When compared to Whites, Hispanic/Latinx and Bi/Multiracial participants did not demonstrate significant differences in presentation across a majority of ED symptoms. Overall findings suggest individuals with female gender and White race may seek treatment from an ED treatment facility with greater frequency than other demographic groups. Noted exceptions include Hispanic/Latinx and Bi/Multi-racial individuals, for whom ED pathology may be represented comparably to Whites.

Yet, there is no research that provides guidance to clinicians providing care for youth with the unique triad of gender dysphoria, ASD, and disordered eating. This case series discusses trends in presentation and management of three cases from a multidisciplinary gender care clinic. All three individuals endorsed rigid thoughts around food and/or body appearance, which affected nutritional intake; however, their presenting eating disorder behaviors, described etiology for disordered thoughts, diagnosis, and level of engagement in a multidisciplinary treatment model varied. Based on these cases we hypothesize several strategies including early engagement with ASD specialists, proactive screening and discussions around eating with all transgender youth with suspected/confirmed ASD, continued discussions throughout care, as disordered eating behaviors may change after the initiation of gender-affirming medications, dietician visits early in treatment regardless of endorsed thoughts and behaviors, tailored management to the unique needs of each individual and their eating thoughts/behaviors, and consistent multidisciplinary collaboration.
