Methods: Data from the Healthy Minds Study 2015–2019 (N = 251,310 U.S. university students) were used in a multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy (MAIHDA). Participants were nested in 35 intersectional strata given by all combinations of 5 gender and 7 racial/ethnic categories. Multilevel logistic models with participants at level 1 and intersectional strata at level 2 were used to estimate stratum-specific predicted prevalence estimates for self-reported thin-ideal internalization, ED symptoms, and ED diagnosis. The variance partition coefficient (VPC) was calculated to quantify the contextual effect of the strata. Results: There was considerable heterogeneity in the predicted prevalence of our ED outcomes across the strata (e.g.,.3%–18.3% for ED diagnoses). There were large disparities in all three outcomes, with transgender participants of color having a higher predicted prevalence than expected based on the additive effects of gender and race/ethnicity. Moderation by race/ethnicity was also apparent, such that racial/ethnic disparities were wider within the cisgender groups relative to the transgender groups. VPCs indicated that ~10% of the total variance in ED outcomes was due to intersectionality between gender and race/ethnicity, over and above variance due to individual-level differences. Conclusion: Findings suggest that gender and racial/ethnic disparities in EDs are interrelated, underscoring the need to develop preventive interventions centering health equity. Public significance: Despite evidence that sexism, racism, and cissexism (i.e., anti-transgender prejudice) can impact EDs risk, little research examines the social patterning of EDs at the intersection of diverse gender and racial/ethnic identities. Using data from a sample of 250,000 U.S. university students, this study found that gender and racial/ethnic disparities in eating disorder risk are interrelated, highlighting the need to develop health equity centered preventive interventions. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","eating disorder symptoms; gender identity; health equity; intersectionality; MAIHDA; multilevel; race/ethnicity; thin-ideal internalization; university students; young adults","Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Gender Identity; Humans; Intersectional Framework; Male; Multilevel Analysis; Students; accuracy; adult; Article; college student; eating disorder; ethnic difference; female; gender identity; health equity; human; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; prevalence; race difference; risk factor; self report; symptom; transgender; United States; intersectionality; multilevel analysis; student","","","","","Harding Distinguished Postgraduate Scholars Fund; National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (K01MH121515); National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA, (K01DA054357); William T.

Less is known about caregiver attitudes or treatment outcome related to premorbid weight history. The current study examined associations between premorbid weight history and patient/caregiver factors at presentation, during treatment, and end of treatment among adolescents (N = 138) diagnosed with AN/AAN and their caregivers who received interdisciplinary ED treatment. The sample comprised adolescents with PHW (n = 58, 40.6 %) or PLW (n = 82, 59.4 %). Adolescents with PHW did not differ with regard to patient- or caregiver-reported ED symptoms, comorbid psychopathology, rates of treatment completion, and attainment of estimated body weight compared to PLW (ps >.05). Adolescents with PHW (vs. PLW) were more likely to be diagnosed with AAN (67.9 %, p <.001), identify as cisgender male (p <.001) and to have lost more weight prior to presentation (p <.001). Perceived caregiver burden was lower among adolescents with PHW vs. PLW (p <.001). Further research should expand on this preliminary study exploring associations between premorbid weight history on patient and caregiver factors at treatment presentation and conclusion to enhance the efficacy of evidence-based treatment across the weight-spectrum. © 2023 The Authors","Anorexia nervosa; Atypical anorexia nervosa; Caregivers; Premorbid weight status; Treatment outcome","Adolescent; Anorexia Nervosa; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Caregivers; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Humans; Male; adolescent; adult; anorexia nervosa; anxiety; Article; body mass; body weight; body weight loss; caregiver burden; child; clinical feature; comorbidity; controlled study; depression; disease association; evidence based medicine; family therapy; female; human; major clinical study; male; medical history; medical record review; multidisciplinary team; premorbid weight status; retrospective study; self report; transgender; anorexia nervosa; anxiety disorder; caregiver; eating disorder","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (K23MH120347, K23MH126201, K23MH131871); National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH; National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, NCCIH, (K23AT011048); National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, NCCIH; National Institute for Health and Care Research, NIHR, (R01HD082166); National Institute for Health and Care Research, NIHR","Funding text 1: This research received no specific grant from any funding agency, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.

Very few interventions have been developed, adapted for, or evaluated in these fundamentally different delivery contexts. Transdiagnostic treatments may be ideal for addressing the comorbidity, complexity, and heterogeneity typical of acute mental health settings. Our aim was to examine initial acceptability and effectiveness of an adaptation of the Unified Protocols for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Children and Adolescents (UP-C/A; Ehrenreich-May, Kennedy, et al., 2017), delivered as part of comprehensive therapeutic programming in a general psychiatric PHP. We recruited 152 youths (M age = 13.1 years, 62.5% female) and caregivers, who participated in an average of 11 days of intensive UP-C/A intervention. Participants rated symptoms and functioning at baseline, weekly, posttreatment, and 1-month follow-up. Latent growth curve modeling was used to examine patterns of change and evaluate the impact of potential demographic and treatment-related covariates. For all outcomes, a quadratic model best fit the data, with symptoms and emotional reactivity decreasing significantly during treatment and then leveling off during follow-up. There was a medium-sized change in functional impairment from baseline to the 1-month follow-up, and ≥90% of participants reported treatment as acceptable and helpful. Results provide initial support for use of a transdiagnostic, cognitive-behavioral intervention in acute mental health settings and suggest important future directions, including controlled trials and investigation of implementation supports. © 2024 Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies","adolescent; child; partial hospitalization; transdiagnostic; treatment","Adolescent; Child; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Pilot Projects; Treatment Outcome; adolescent; aged; anxiety disorder; Article; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; autism; bipolar disorder; body dysmorphic disorder; caregiver; child; clinical effectiveness; clinical evaluation; cognitive behavioral therapy; comorbidity; depression; drug dependence; eating disorder; ethnicity; female; follow up; gender dysphoria; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; mental health; obsessive compulsive disorder; sex ratio; treatment outcome; treatment planning; mental disease; patient attitude; pilot study; procedures; psychology; therapy","","","","","American Psychological Foundation, APF; Children's Hospital Colorado Research Institute; Baylor College of Medicine; Woebot, Inc.","This work was supported by grants from the American Psychological Foundation and Children's Hospital Colorado Research Institute to the first author.

Methods: Using an online survey with participants from France (n = 952), social rejection was assessed using a feeling thermometer and a social distance scale, while social perceptions were measured using visual analog scales. Results: A stigma map for these different disorders is drawn up, revealing the social perceptions and levels of stigmatization specific to certain mental illnesses. Controlling for relevant social perceptions (i.e., danger, warmth, competence), we found that perception of burden was positively and significantly associated to social distance and negative feeling for 73% and 67% of mental illnesses, respectively. The perception of vital force was negatively and significantly related to social distance and negative feeling for 87% and 20% of mental illnesses, respectively. The change in R2 between model 1 (i.e. perception of danger, warmth, competence) and model 2 (i.e. model 1 + perceptions of vital force and burden) significantly improved in 100% of cases for social distance and 67% of cases for negative feeling. Conclusion: These preliminary data provide support for the SUBAR model and call for further investigations to better understand the social rejection of people with mental illnesses.

This research builds on prior data exploring the positive effects of tattooing and investigates how tattoos impact one’s relationship to eating disorder (ED) recovery and body image. We held three focus groups lasting 60 minutes each, recruiting participants via purposive snowball sampling (n = 15), with additional opportunities to respond to focus group prompts asynchronously. Eligible participants were individuals with lived experience of an ED, self-identified as being in recovery, had three or more tattoos, and spoke English. Participants predominantly held gender-expansive (n = 4 Non-Binary, n = 3 Genderqueer, n = 3 Cisgender Women, n = 3 Transgender, n = 2 Transmasculine, n = 2 Gender Non-Conforming, n = 2 Intersex, n = 1 Cisgender Man) and non-heterosexual identities. Focus groups were held between April 2021 and July 2023 and followed a semi-structured interview format. Primary analyses focused on participants’ responses to open-ended prompts regarding how they understood the relationships between tattooing, body image, and ED recovery. Thematic analysis identified four core themes: Tattooing allowing for embodiment, tattooing allowing for recovery-oriented behaviors, tattooing enabling positive body image, and tattooing facilitating empowerment. An overarching message was that tattooing is a therapeutic and transformative process, allowing for self-determination. Participants indicated that tattooing can be experienced as a powerful mechanism for behavioral change and shifts in relationship to one’s body. Participants expressed that tattooing can be an effective route towards both gender euphoria and body liberation, enhancing one’s ability to maintain ED recovery. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Adult; Body Image; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Focus Groups; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Qualitative Research; Self Concept; Tattooing; Transgender Persons; Young Adult; Article; body image; clinical article; eating disorder; emotionality; euphoria; experience; female; gender; gender reassignment; heterosexuality; homosexual female; human; interrater reliability; intersex; investment; male; perception; personality; public health surveillance; qualitative analysis; self compassion; self evaluation; semantics; semi structured interview; sexuality; social aspect; social media; tattooing; transgender; transgender and gender nonbinary; adult; information processing; middle aged; psychology; qualitative research; self concept; young adult","","","","","","","Aghazadeh S.A., “Recovery warriors”: The national eating disorders Association’s online community and rhetorical vision, Public Relations Inquiry, 11, 1, pp. 103-119, (2022); Alter-Muri S., The body as canvas: Motivations, meanings, and therapeutic implications of tattoos, Art Therapy, 37, 3, pp. 1-8, (2019); Arnaud S., Sullivan J., Mackinnon A.J., Bodell L.P., Teasing apart the roles of interoception, emotion, and self-control in anorexia nervosa, Review of Philosophy and Psychology, (2023); Bar S.T., How tattoos can help improve body image, (2019); Beischel W.J., Gauvin S.E.M., van Anders S.M., “A little shiny gender breakthrough”: Community understandings of gender euphoria, International Journal of Transgender Health, 23, 3, pp. 274-294, (2021); Bell K., Rieger E., Hirsch J.K., Eating disorder symptoms and proneness in gay men, lesbian women, and transgender and gender non-conforming adults: Comparative levels and a proposed mediational model, Frontiers in Psychology, 9, 2692, (2019); Bormann E.G., Cragan J.F., Shields D.C., Three decades of developing, grounding, and using symbolic convergence theory (SCT), Annals of the International Communication Association, 25, 1, pp. 271-313, (2001); Braun T.D., Park C.L., Gorin A., Self-compassion, body image, and disordered eating: A review of the literature, Body Image, 17, pp. 117-131, (2016); Brewer G., Hanson L., Caswell N., Body image and eating behavior in transgender men and women: The importance of stage of gender affirmation, Bulletin of Applied Transgender Studies, 1, 1-2, pp. 71-95, (2022); Buss L., Hodges K., Marked: Tattoo as an expression of psyche, Psychological Perspectives, 60, 1, pp. 4-38, (2017); Cascino G., Castellini G., Stanghellini G., Ricca V., Cassioli E., Ruzzi V., Monteleone P., Monteleone A.M., The role of the embodiment disturbance in the anorexia nervosa psychopathology: A network analysis study, Brain Sciences, 9, 10, (2019); Chen P.J., ‘It’s the outline of a pig and then it has the words underneath, “vegan for life”’: Vegans and their tattoos, Animal Studies Journal, 9, 2, pp. 260-283, (2020); Clarke V., Braun V., Teaching thematic analysis: Overcoming challenges and developing strategies for effective learning, The Psychologist, 26, 2, pp. 120-123, (2013); Cook-Cottone C.P., Embodiment and the treatment of eating disorders: The body as a resource in recovery, (2020); Crompton L., Plotkin Amrami G., Tsur N., Solomon Z., Tattoos in the wake of trauma: Transforming personal stories of suffering into public stories of coping, Deviant Behavior, 42, 10, pp. 1242-1255, (2020); Damani S., Button E.J., Reveley C.H., The body image structured interview: A new method for the exploration of body image in women with eating disorders, European Eating Disorders Review, 9, 3, pp. 167-181, (2001); Galupo M.P., Cusack C.E., Morris E.R., “Having a non-normative body for me is about survival”: Androgynous body ideal among trans and nonbinary individuals, Body Image, 39, pp. 68-76, (2021); Goetz T.G., Wolk C.B., Moving toward targeted eating disorder care for transgender, non‐binary, and gender expansive patients in the United States, The International Journal of Eating Disorders, 56, 12, pp. 2210-2222, (2023); Guest G., Namey E., McKenna K., How many focus groups are enough?

While ED rates have risen during the COVID pandemic, trends in co-occurring autism, ADHD, and GD have yet to be investigated in detail or at scale by way of large electronic medical record data. Objectives: To investigate trends in rates of co-occurring autism, ADHD, and GD among children, adolescents, and young adults with EDs in years prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We utilized a de-identified multinational electronic health records database (TriNetX) with 48,558 individuals aged 5-26 diagnosed with eating disorders (EDs) at least twice between 2017 and 2022. The primary predictor variable differentiated between the years of each person’s index (first) ED diagnosis (2017-2019 vs. 2020-2022). The primary outcome variable was the rate of new co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses of autism, ADHD, and GD in the year following each patient’s first ED diagnosis. We applied propensity score-matched multivariable logistic regressions to compare primary outcomes between 2017-2019 and 2020-2022. Results: Our analysis included 17,445 individuals diagnosed with EDs in 2017-2019 (8% autism, 13.5% ADHD, 1.9% GD) and 31,113 diagnosed with EDs in 2020-2022 (8% autism, 14.6% ADHD, 3.2% GD). After 1:1 propensity score matching, 17,202 individuals from the 2017-2019 cohort were matched to peers mirroring the 2020-2022 cohort. Those diagnosed in 2020-2022 showed a 19% (aOR[95%CI]=1.19[1.07-1.33]), 25% (aOR=1.25[1.04-1.49]), and 36% (aOR=1.36[1.07-1.74]) increase in odds for autism, ADHD, and GD diagnoses, respectively, within the 365 days after the index EDs diagnosis, compared to the 2017-2019 cohort. Discussion: Rates of autism, ADHD, and GD are significantly higher in individuals with ED in the post-pandemic 2020-2022 cohort in comparison to the pre-pandemic 2017-2019 cohort, even after controlling for baseline levels of co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses. Such findings reveal a critical gap in our current understanding of the totality of ways in which COVID-19 may have impacted the onset and clinical course of EDs, autism, ADHD, and GD among children, adolescents, and young adults.

Methods: A pragmatic, real-world evaluation was conducted on the Youth Brief Intervention Service between June 2021 (inception) and October 2022. Service users were offered four sessions over an approximate one-month period. Sessions focused on distress tolerance, safety plans and support systems. Implementation outcomes related to service uptake, retention, fidelity of the model and service user experience. Effectiveness outcomes were measured pre-post and included mental health-related hospital service utilization (primary outcome), functioning, mental health status, self-harm, suicidal ideation and quality of life. Results: Of the 136 young people referred to the Youth Brief Intervention Service, 99 were accepted with 17 disengaging before the first session. Eighty percent of people who commenced, completed the package of care. Young persons' and parent/carers experience of service was high (97% and 88%, respectively). Mental health-related emergency department presentations and inpatient days decreased from 3 months pre-intake to 3 months post-intake (42 vs. 7 presentations, X2 = 25.3, p <.001; 11 vs. 0 inpatient days, X2 = 9.1, p =.01). There were significant improvements in mental health status, days engaging in self-harm, general health and functioning and quality of life. Conclusions: The Youth Brief Intervention Service is feasible, acceptable, subjectively beneficial and coincided with less mental health-related emergency department presentations and inpatient days, and improved mental health status and behaviour. © 2024 The Authors.

We conducted a retrospective longitudinal study by analyzing ED visits for MHDs from 10 March 2019 to 10 March 2021. A total of 1407 ED visits for MHDs were registered: 702 in the pre-COVID-19 and 707 in the COVID-19 period. The cumulative incidence of ED visits for MHDs was 1.22% in the pre-COVID-19 period and 1.77% in the COVID-19 period, with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001). The principal characteristics of the adolescent with MHDs during the pandemic period: the odds of comorbidities decreased by 26% (p = 0.02), and the odds of transfer from other hospitals decreased by 71% (p < 0.001), while the odds of the ED presentation as first psychiatric episode were twice greater (p < 0.001). The risk of hospitalization increased by 54% (p = 0.001). Regarding psychopathology, the likelihood of attempted suicide increased by 74% during the pandemic (p = 0.02). The rate of mood and eating disorders grew significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic period (p = 0.005 and p = 0.031, respectively). Monitoring ED visits for MHDs and understanding changes in the profile of adolescents presenting to ED helps to reinforce the role of ED in identifying special clinical needs for these vulnerable patients in case of a future public health crisis. © 2023 by the authors.","adolescent; COVID-19 pandemic; eating disorders; emergency department; mental health disorders; mood disorders; suicide","adolescent; adult; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; cumulative incidence; depression; electronic health record; emergency ward; female; gender dysphoria; health care delivery; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; mental disease; mental health; mood disorder; pandemic; public health; restlessness; retrospective study; risk factor; schizophrenia; sleep disorder; virus transmission","","","","","Ministero della Salute","We appreciate the support given to this work by the Italian Ministry of Health through a donation not linked to a specific grant buy to “Current Research Funds”.

The current study assessed stigma experiences from peers at school, self-esteem, LGBTQ pride, and overlapping social positions as they relate to disordered eating behaviors among LGBTQ adolescents. Method: Participants included 11,083 adolescents (Mage = 15.6, SD = 1.3; 34.8% transgender/gender diverse) from a large national survey study of LGBTQ adolescents from 2017. Exhaustive Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detection analysis was used to identify bias-based bullying experiences (i.e., weight-based, identity-based), self-esteem, LGBTQ pride, and overlapping social positions (i.e., gender identity, sexual identity, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI) percentile) associated with the highest prevalence of unhealthy weight control behaviors, extreme unhealthy weight control behaviors, and past year binge eating. Results: Adolescents in the 28 identified groups with a high prevalence of disordered eating behavior held at least one structurally marginalized social position (e.g., high BMI), bias-based bullying experience, low self-esteem, or low LGBTQ pride in addition to being LGBTQ. Weight-based bullying was a salient risk-factor for disordered eating across social positions. Among adolescents with the same social positions, levels of self-esteem, LGBTQ pride, but no bias-based bullying experience, prevalence estimates of disordered eating were, on average, 23% lower. Discussion: LGBTQ adolescents with multiple marginalized social positions and related factors engage in disproportionately high prevalence disordered eating. Findings underscore the importance of addressing intersecting experiences of stigma to reduce disordered eating and promote health equity among adolescents. Public significance: Multiply marginalized LGBTQ adolescents, most of whom also reported experiencing bias-based bullying from peers at school, reported disproportionately high prevalence disordered eating. In comparison groups of adolescents with no bias-based bullying experience, prevalence of disordered eating was, on average, 24% lower. Findings underscore the importance of addressing intersecting experiences of stigma to reduce disordered eating and promote health equity among adolescents. © 2023 The Authors.

A sample of 441 non-clinical participants (65 % White, mean age = 27) reported their gender (104 cisgender men, 229 cisgender women, 28 transgender men, 27 transgender women, 53 nonbinary) and sexual orientation (144 straight, 45 gay, 54 lesbian, 105 bisexual/pansexual, 68 queer), and completed the Orthorexia Nervosa Inventory. The LGBTQ group exhibited greater ON symptomatology compared to the cisgender, straight group. ANOVAs demonstrated significant group differences according to gender and sexual orientation. Post-hoc tests revealed that transgender women exhibited greater ON symptomatology than cisgender men and cisgender women. However, nonbinary individuals exhibited lower ON symptomatology than cisgender women, transgender men, and transgender women. Additionally, lesbians exhibited greater ON symptomatology than straight individuals. Our findings suggest that individuals with an LGBTQ identity, particularly transgender women and lesbians, may experience greater ON symptomatology than cisgender, straight individuals. However, nonbinary individuals appear to experience lower ON symptomatology, which may relate to a lack of alignment with masculine or feminine ideals, such that these individuals may feel a lack of need to conform to a certain appearance ideal based on gender norms. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Disordered eating;

Methods: This cross-sectional study was part of a larger study in which an online survey was administered during autumn quarter 2020 to undergraduate students at a northwestern U.S. public university. Measures included EC (ecSI 2.0™), weight-and-body shame and/or guilt (WEB–SG), weight satisfaction, current weight loss effort, and eating disorder risk. Results: Of the 1996 respondents included in the final analyses, 40.2 % were eating competent (ecSI 2.0™ ≥32). Gender distribution was 71.6 % women, 23.1 % men, and 4.6 % trans-and-gender non-conforming (TGNC). WEB–SG and WEB-S were higher in women and TGNC than in men. Weight satisfaction was lower in women and TGNC students than men, and 47.3 % of the sample was trying to lose weight at the time of the study. Eating disorder (ED) risk was prevalent with nearly 34 % scoring ≥2 on SCOFF and 33 % reporting they saw themselves as having an ED now or in the past. Significant factors of EC varied for each gender, although WEB-S was a shared model factor for all genders. Conclusion: EC may be protective, as this was related to less WEB-S in all genders; less WEB-G and greater weight satisfaction in men and women; and lower likelihood of ED risk and trying to lose weight among women. Further research is needed to elucidate whether these maladaptive weight-and-body attitudes and behaviors in college students can be improved to increase EC.

Method: Participants were 44 TGD and 573 cisgender adolescents admitted to a treatment facility. Participants completed the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) at admission and discharge. Results: Both groups had elevated EDE-Q scores at admission (TGD: M = 3.78, standard deviation [SD] = 1.70; cisgender: M = 3.33, SD = 1.74) that improved by discharge (TGD: M = 2.27, SD = 1.83, Cohen's d =.98; cisgender: M = 2.10, SD = 1.54, Cohen's d =.79); there were no differences in EDE-Q between groups at admission (p =.09; odds ratio [OR] = 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] [.98, 1.44]) or discharge (p =.48; OR = 1.07, 95% CI [.88, 1.30]). On admission, TGD adolescents had higher suicidality, measured by PHQ-9, item 9 (p <.001; OR = 1.94, 95% CI [1.51, 2.52]), and depression (p <.001; OR = 1.10, 95% CI [1.05, 1.16]) than cisgender participants. Severity decreased over treatment for all measures. Both groups showed similar improvement on suicidality (p =.93; OR =.98, 95% CI [.70,1.36]), depression (p =.42; OR = 1.02, 95% CI [.97, 1.07]), and anxiety (p =.14; OR = 1.05, 95% CI [.99, 1.12]). However, at discharge, suicidality (p =.02; OR = 1.40, 95% CI [1.04, 1.85]), depression (p <.01; OR = 1.06, 95% CI [1.02, 1.11]), and anxiety (p =.02; OR = 1.06, 95% CI [1.01, 1.12]) were higher for TGD adolescents than their cisgender peers. Discussion: All participants had similar ED symptom severity and improvement. Depression, anxiety, and suicidality remained elevated for TGD adolescents compared to their cisgender peers at discharge, suggesting the need for targeted treatment. Public Significance: Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) adolescents have increased risk of eating disorders (EDs); few studies examine how they respond to ED treatment. We examine treatment outcomes of TGD adolescents receiving ED treatment compared to their cisgender peers. We measured ED symptoms along with depression, anxiety, and suicidality at the beginning and end of treatment. While TGD adolescents showed similar improvement in ED symptoms, measures of depression, anxiety, and suicidality remained elevated at the time of discharge. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","adolescence;

This risk is especially pronounced among adolescents whose home environment is unsupportive or nonaffirming, as these adolescents may face familial rejection due to their identity. Therefore, it is critical to better understand the mechanisms underlying this risk by probing temporally sensitive associations between negative mood and time spent in potentially hostile home environments. The current study included adolescents (N = 141; 43% SGM; 13–18 years old), oversampled for depression history, who completed clinical interviews assessing lifetime psychiatric history and depression severity as well as self-report measures of social support. Participants also installed an app on their personal smartphones, which assessed their daily mood and geolocation-determined mobility patterns over a 6-month followup period. Over the 6-month follow-up period, SGM adolescents reported elevated depression severity and lower daily mood relative to non-SGM youth. Interestingly, SGM adolescents who reported low family support experienced lower daily mood than non-SGM adolescents, particularly on days when they spent more time at home. Current findings reinforce evidence for disparities in depression severity among SGM adolescents and highlight family support as a key factor. Specifically, more time spent in home environments with low family support was associated with worse mood among SGM adolescents. These results underscore the need for clinical interventions to support SGM youth, particularly interventions that focus on familial relationships and social support within the home environment. © 2024 American Psychological Association","adolescent; depression; experience sampling method; geolocation; sexual and gender minority","adolescent; adult; anxiety; Article; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; binge eating disorder; bipolar disorder; chi square test; daily life activity; depression; distress syndrome; electroencephalography; emotionality; family support; female; follow up; gender dysphoria; geolocation; home environment; homosexual female; household income; human; interview; Likert scale; major clinical study; major depression; male; medical history; Mini Mental State Examination; mood; outcome assessment; physical abuse; physiological stress; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychosis; questionnaire; reproductive health; retinopathy; risk factor; self report; sexual and gender minority; sexual orientation; social interaction; social phobia; social support; suicide attempt; transgender; wellbeing","","","","","","","Auerbach R.

Although research supports a link between discrimination and DEBs among LGBTQ+ populations, few studies have specifically investigated healthcare discrimination and DEBs in this population. This study examined whether LGBTQ+ status moderated the relation between negative healthcare experiences and DEBs in undergraduates. Undergraduates (n = 322) from a Southeastern (United States) university completed measures of healthcare discrimination, trust in physicians, and DEBs. Analyses investigated whether LGBTQ+ status moderated the relation between healthcare discrimination and DEBs; trust in physicians and DEBs. LGBTQ+ individuals (35% of sample), reported less trust in physicians (p <.001), and more body dissatisfaction (p =.007) and shape/weight overvaluation (p =.008). Among all undergraduates, experiences of healthcare discrimination were associated with higher body dissatisfaction (p =.003) and shape/weight overvaluation (p =.008). Less trust in physicians was associated with greater shape/weight overvaluation (p =.005). LGBTQ+ status did not moderate either relation. It is important to reduce healthcare discrimination and foster patient–provider trust for all young adults. Future research should examine factors influencing patient–provider trust among LGBTQ+ individuals. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Adolescent; Adult; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Humans;

TNG individuals with EDs are dramatically higher risk for self-harm behaviors, suicidal ideation, and suicidal behaviors than cisgender peers with EDs or TNG peers without EDs, and often engage in ED symptoms/behaviors to alleviate gender dysphoria. Yet, no treatment paradigms have yet been adapted for TNG-specific ED care. This qualitative study aims to identify stakeholder needs from such care to inform future clinical interventions. Methods: We elicited patient (n = 12) and mental health clinician (n = 9) stakeholder needs and preferences regarding TNG-specific ED care. Semi-structured interview guides informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and a behavioral insights framework, EAST, were developed to ensure uniform inclusion and sequencing of topics and allow for valid comparison across interviews. Using a rapid analysis procedure, we produced a descriptive analysis for each group identifying challenges of and opportunities in providing ED care for TNG adults. Results: Stakeholders expressed needs and preferences for TNG-specific treatment including that it be: (1) TNG-affirming, weight-inclusive, trauma-informed, and anti-racist; (2) delivered by an interdisciplinary team, including gender-affirming care clinicians; (3) focused on parsing gender dysphoria from other body image concerns, building distress tolerance, and working toward gender euphoria (rather than body acceptance). Discussion: Future work is needed exploring ED care delivery models that integrate gender-affirming care services with mental health care. Such models may improve TNG access to ED treatment and recovery. Public Significance: Transgender, non-binary, and/or gender expansive (TNG) experience disproportionately high rates of eating disorders and have unique barriers to accessing care. In individual interviews, TNG adults with eating disorders and mental health clinicians who provide psychotherapy for eating disorders voiced desire for greater availability of TNG-affirming, weight-inclusive eating disorder care, integrated with other gender-affirming care services. This informs future research developing eating disorder care for TNG individuals. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","disordered eating; eating disorder; gender-affirming; implementation science; mental health;

However, prolactin monitoring is rarely conducted (0.1–10 %), and the prevalence and characteristics of abnormal prolactin levels remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of abnormal prolactin levels and identify the factors influencing serum prolactin levels in pediatric and adolescent patients treated with antipsychotics in a real-world clinical setting. Method: This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at Nagoya University Hospital and included consecutive 489 patients with psychiatric disorders aged <18 years who underwent serum prolactin monitoring. Because all hospitalized patients were included, sampling bias was minimized. Data on patient demographics, psychiatric diagnoses, medications, and prolactin levels were extracted and analyzed. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the factors influencing serum prolactin levels. Analysis of covariance was used to assess the effects of different antipsychotics on prolactin levels. Results: Hyperprolactinemia was observed in 23.0 % of patients treated with antipsychotics, whereas hypoprolactinemia was observed in 13.7 % of patients. Domperidone, sulpiride, and antipsychotics significantly increased prolactin levels. Risperidone, olanzapine, and blonanserin were associated with significantly increased serum prolactin levels, whereas aripiprazole was associated with hypoprolactinemia. Conclusion: Approximately 40 % of pediatric patients treated with antipsychotics exhibited abnormal prolactin levels. Clinicians should routinely monitor prolactin levels and consider prolactin-related side effects when prescribing antipsychotics to children and adolescents. These findings emphasize the importance of tailored antipsychotic therapy to minimize the adverse effects in this vulnerable population. © 2025 The Authors","Adolescent psychiatry; Antipsychotics; Cross-sectional; Prolactin; Psychiatric disorders","Adolescent; Antipsychotic Agents; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Hyperprolactinemia; Male; Mental Disorders; Prolactin; Retrospective Studies; aripiprazole; blonanserin; domperidone; neuroleptic agent; olanzapine; prolactin; risperidone; sulpiride; prolactin; addiction; adolescent; analysis of covariance; anxiety disorder; Article; bipolar disorder; child; controlled study; cross-sectional study; depression; dissociative disorder; eating disorder; epilepsy; feeding disorder; female; gender dysphoria; human; hyperprolactinemia; hypoprolactinemia; Japan; major clinical study; male; mental disease; multiple regression; observational study; obsessive compulsive disorder; personality disorder; prolactin blood level; retrospective study; schizophrenia; sleep disorder; somatoform disorder; blood; drug therapy; epidemiology; hyperprolactinemia","","aripiprazole, 129722-12-9; blonanserin, 132810-10-7; domperidone, 57808-66-9; olanzapine, 132539-06-1, 221373-09-7, 221373-18-8; prolactin, 12585-34-1, 50647-00-2, 9002-62-4; risperidone, 106266-06-2; sulpiride, 15676-16-1; Antipsychotic Agents, ; Prolactin, ","","","","","Al Harthi M.S., Al Ghafri T.S., Al Wasify L., Al Akhzami S., AlHarthi A., Al Harthi S., Al Sibani N., Hyperprolactinemia in adults treated with anti-psychotic drugs attending tertiary hospitals in Oman: an observational study, Cureus, 14, (2022); Alosaimi F.D., Fallata E.O., Abalhassan M., Alhabbad A., Alzain N., Alhaddad B., Alassiry M.Z., Prevalence and risk factors of hyperprolactinemia among patients with various psychiatric diagnoses and medications, Int.

In this two-part study, we used quantitative and qualitative methods to: (1) assess incidence of optimal versus suboptimal transitions of care for AYA with DGBI, (2) characterize health and quality of life effects of the transition, and (3) identify barriers and facilitators for optimal transition of care. Methods: In Part 1, we conducted a retrospective review of AYA referrals to our adult neurogastroenterology clinic who had transitioned from pediatric gastroenterology care (N = 109, 17–23 years, 72% female). We collected demographic, psychosocial, and healthcare utilization data to determine rate and risk factors for suboptimal transitions. In Part 2, we recruited 24 AYA and parents (n = 19 AYA, n = 5 parents) for completion of a survey and semistructured interview, which was analyzed using validated rapid qualitative analysis method. Results: In Part 1, 20% (22/109) of AYA met the criteria for suboptimal transition of care, which was associated with treatment adherence concern and functional impairment. In Part 2, we identified two principal themes: (1) AYA's health and quality of life are impacted during the transition, and (2) parental involvement and collaboration with pediatric gastrointestinal are facilitators to successful transitions, whereas access to care and practice style change are barriers. Conclusion: AYA with DGBI have high rates of suboptimal care transitions, affecting their health and quality of life. Our study highlights the need for a comprehensive approach that incorporates parents and pediatric providers. © 2024 European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition and North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition.","functional abdominal pain; functional GI disorders; irritable bowel syndrome; young adults","Adolescent; Brain-Gut Axis; Female; Gastroenterology; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Humans; Male; Quality of Life; Retrospective Studies; Transition to Adult Care; Young Adult; digestive tract agent; adolescent; adult; anorexia; anxiety; Article; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; autism; bipolar disorder; bloating; brain disease; brain-gut axis; cohort analysis; constipation; controlled study; depression; diarrhea; drug dependence; dyspepsia; dysphagia; emergency department visit; employment status; enteropathy; esophagus achalasia; esophagus disease; female; functional disease; gastroesophageal reflux; gastrointestinal symptom; health care access; health care survey; health care utilization; human; incidence; irritable colon; lower gastrointestinal tract; major clinical study; male; medical record review; nausea and vomiting; obsessive compulsive disorder; patient compliance; patient referral; pediatrics; posttraumatic stress disorder; qualitative research; quality of life; quantitative study; retrospective study; semi structured interview; stomach paresis; time interval; transgender; transition to adult care; brain-gut axis; gastroenterology; gastrointestinal disease; psychology; therapy; young adult","","","","","Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, CFF; American College of Gastroenterology, ACG; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK, (K23 DK131334); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK","Funding text 1: Helen Burton\u2010Murray receives royalties from Oxford University Press for her forthcoming book on rumination syndrome.

This study aimed to (1) assess the measurement invariance of a short DE scale among high school students in Canada, and (2) estimate differences in scale scores across student sociodemographic subgroups. Methods: We used student-level survey data collected during the 2021/2022 school year in the COMPASS study. The sample included 24,639 students in grades 9–12 from 69 secondary schools in Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario, Canada. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis was applied to assess measurement invariance (i.e., configural, metric, scalar, and strict invariance) of the 6-item DE scale, and one-way ANOVA and mixed linear regression were implemented to estimate scale score differences across population subgroups (by grade, gender, race and ethnicity, family affluence, and weight status). Results: Results demonstrated full measurement invariance of the DE scale across student sociodemographic subgroups. Higher sum scale scores indicated greater engagement in DE thoughts or behaviours. Students in higher school grade (e.g., grade 12), transgender and gender diverse youth, and cisgender girls reported higher DE scores compared to their grade 9 and cisgender boy peers. Elevated DE scores were also observed among adolescents of Middle Eastern and Another or Multiethnic identity, students with less affluent households, and those with higher body weights, relative to their White, more affluent, and relatively lower weight peers, respectively. Conclusions: Results indicate the DE scale measures the same construct across various subgroups of adolescents, providing confidence that differences in scale scores found by grade, gender, race and ethnicity, affluence, and weight reflect actual differences in DE rather than artifactual differences in scale interpretation. This scale warrants additional psychometric testing as a promising brief DE measure suitable for large population-level youth surveys. Our results provide important new evidence from a large contemporary sample of adolescents demonstrating elevated risk of DE among specific subgroups and emphasizing the need for targeted interventions. © The Author(s) 2025.","Adolescents; Disordered eating; Measurement invariance; Validity; Youth","","","","","","Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux, MSSS; Health Canada, (1617-HQ-000012); Health Canada; Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR, (PJT-149092, PJT-159693, PJT-148562); Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR; Sick Kids Foundation, (UIP 178846, NI21-1193); Sick Kids Foundation; Institute of Nutrition, Metabolism and Diabetes, INMD, (OOP-110788); Institute of Nutrition, Metabolism and Diabetes, INMD; Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, CCSA, (OF7 B1-PCPEGT 410-10-9633, PJT-180262); Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, CCSA; Institute of Population and Public Health, IPPH, (MOP-114875); Institute of Population and Public Health, IPPH","The COMPASS study has been supported by a bridge grant from the CIHR Institute of Nutrition, Metabolism and Diabetes (INMD) through the \u201CObesity\u2013 Interventions to Prevent or Treat\u201D priority funding awards (OOP-110788; awarded to STL), an operating grant from the CIHR Institute of Population and Public Health (IPPH) (MOP-114875; awarded to STL), a CIHR project grant (PJT-148562; awarded to STL), a CIHR bridge grant (PJT-149092; awarded to KAP/STL), a CIHR project grant (PJT-159693; awarded to KAP), and by a research funding arrangement with Health Canada (#1617-HQ-000012; contract awarded to STL), a CIHR-Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse (CCSA) team grant (OF7 B1-PCPEGT 410-10-9633; awarded to STL), a project grant from the CIHR Institute of Population and Public Health (IPPH) (PJT-180262; awarded to STL and KAP).

Despite evidence from cisgender samples linking sexual assault exposure to body image concerns and disordered eating behaviors, such as weight and shape control behaviors (WSCBs), little is known about these relationships in TNB people. The purpose of this study was to assess associations among past-year sexual assault exposure, body areas satisfaction, body weight esteem, and high-risk WSCBs in a sample of TNB young adults. Methods: A sample of 714 participants completed a cross-sectional online survey. Multivariable linear and logistic models were fit to determine associations between constructs of interest. Natural effects mediation analyses assessed for potential mediation of the relationship between sexual assault and WSCBs by body areas satisfaction and body weight esteem. Analyses were stratified by three gender identity categories. Results: Past-year sexual assault exposure was associated with significantly decreased body areas satisfaction, but only for nonbinary participants. No significant association was found between sexual assault and body weight esteem. Sexual assault was associated with significantly increased risk for WSCBs across gender identity categories. No mediation of these relationships by body areas satisfaction and body weight esteem was observed. Conclusion: Findings support clinical consideration of WSCBs in TNB survivors of sexual assault. Results suggest that multiple factors, including body image and sexual assault, may contribute separately to disordered eating behaviors in TNB young adults. ª Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","body image; dehumanization; disordered eating; nonbinary; sexual violence; transgender","Body Image; Body Weight; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Gender Identity; Humans; Male; Sex Offenses; Transgender Persons; Young Adult; body image; body weight; cross-sectional study; female; gender identity; human; male; sexual crime; transgender; young adult","","","","","Aerosmith Endowment Fund for the Prevention and Treatment of HIV; Harvard University Open Gate Foundation; National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (1R25GM111837-01); National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH","The Body Image, Sexual Health and Relationships Project (B*SHARP) was funded by the Aerosmith Endowment Fund for the Prevention and Treatment of HIV and Other Sexually Transmitted Infections; Harvard University Open Gate Foundation; and the Research Education Institute for Diverse Scholars (REIDS) pilot grant from National Institute of Mental Health grant 1R25GM111837-01.

Yet, our knowledge of gender dysphoria and related outcomes is restricted due to the lack of high-quality studies employing comprehensive approaches. This longitudinal study aims to enhance our knowledge of gender dysphoria; different aspects will be scrutinised, focusing primarily on the psychosocial and mental health outcomes, prognostic markers and, secondarily, on the underlying mechanisms for its origin. Methods and analysis The Swedish Gender Dysphoria Study is an ongoing multicentre longitudinal cohort study with 501 registered participants with gender dysphoria who are 15 years old or older. Participants at different phases of their clinical evaluation process can enter the study, and the expected follow-up duration is three years. The study also includes a comparison group of 458 age- and county-matched individuals without gender dysphoria. Data on the core outcomes of the study, which are gender incongruence and experienced gender dysphoria, body satisfaction and satisfaction with gender-affirming treatments, as well as other relevant outcomes, including mental health, social functioning and life satisfaction, are collected via web surveys. Two different research visits, before and after starting on gender-affirming hormonal treatment (if applicable), are planned to collect respective biological and cognitive measures. Data analysis will be performed using appropriate biostatistical methods. A power analysis showed that the current sample size is big enough to analyse continuous and categorical outcomes, and participant recruitment will continue until December 2022. Ethics and dissemination The ethical permission for this study was obtained from the Local Ethical Review Board in Uppsala, Sweden. Results of the study will be presented at national and international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals.

Few studies have examined the comorbid risks associated with OCD despite the increased prevalence of OCD among young adults. This study examined substance use and disordered eating risk associated with OCD conditions among college students and how this association may vary by sex/gender. Methods Data were from 92,757 undergraduate students aged 18–24 enrolled in 216 colleges between Fall 2021 and Fall 2022, from the American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment III. Regression models were used to estimate alcohol, cannabis, tobacco, and disordered eating risk among those with OCD related conditions compared to those without conditions, overall and by sex/gender, while adjusting for covariates and school clustering. Results Students with OCD conditions displayed a higher prevalence of substance use and disordered eating risks. In adjusted models, OCD conditions were associated with increased odds of moderate/high tobacco (aOR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.05, 1.21), cannabis (aOR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.04, 1.18), alcohol (aOR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.05, 1.24) and disordered eating risk (aOR = 2.28, 95% CI 2.13, 2.43). Analyses stratified by gender revealed cis-female students with OCD conditions were at increased risk for moderate/high risk alcohol (aOR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.08, 1.29), tobacco (aOR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.03, 1.22), cannabis (aOR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.06, 1.23) and disordered eating (aOR = 2.30, 9%% CI 2.14, 2.47). Among TGNC students, OCD conditions were associated with increased risk for moderate/high tobacco risk (aOR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.05, 1.48) and disordered eating (aOR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.85, 2.47). OCD conditions was only associated with disordered eating among male students (aOR = 2.34, 95% CI 1.93, 2.83). Discussion Young adult college students with OCD conditions exhibit a higher prevalence of medium/ high risk alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use and disordered eating compared to their counterparts without such conditions, even after adjusting for stress, depression, and anxiety. © 2025 Jacobs et al.

The patient group consisted of all patients who were referred to the Helsinki University Hospital’s Gender Identity Clinic (GIC) wanting medical treatment for detransition from 2018 to 2019. A new assessment was made systematically and retrospective data were collected. The sample consisted of nine patients originally diagnosed with gender identity disorder (F64.0). Seven of them were assigned female at birth and two were assigned male at birth. All seven females at birth had “major” regret and both males at birth had “minor” regret. All patients except one male assigned at birth wanted their previous GAT to be reversed. The mean regret time (i.e., time from the first diagnosis of F64.0 to the beginning of the new evaluation period) was seven years. The detransitioners had a high number of psychiatric diagnoses. Childhood trauma, sexual abuse or rape, eating disorder symptoms, borderline personality, and psychotic symptoms were common among detransitioners. Retrospectively, the patients reported that the need for transitioning in the first place was not the transgender identity or gender dysphoria, but reasons related to the maturation process and unresolved psychological stressors.

Gender-diverse individuals from non-Western cultural contexts (e.g., China) are at potentially high risk for WBI. Yet, no research has examined WBI and associated negative health consequences in this historically underrepresented population. Method: A cross-sectional, online survey sampled Chinese gender-diverse individuals (N = 410, Mage = 22.33 years). Variables were self-reported, including demographics, WBI, body shame, body dissatisfaction, disordered eating, physical and mental health status, and gender minority stress (e.g., internalized cisgenderism). Analyses included correlations and multiple hierarchical regressions. Results: Pearson bivariate correlations demonstrated associations between higher WBI and more eating and body image disturbances and poor physical and mental health. After adjusting for age, BMI, gender identity, and gender minority stress, higher WBI was uniquely and positively associated with higher body shame, higher body dissatisfaction, higher disordered eating, and poor physical and mental health. Notably, WBI accounted for more unique variance in eating and body image disturbances (13%–25% explained by WBI) than physical and mental health (1%–4% explained by WBI). Discussion: While replication with longitudinal and experimental designs is needed to speak to the temporal dynamics and causality, our findings identify WBI as a unique, meaningful correlate of eating and body image disturbances in Chinese gender-diverse adults. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","body dissatisfaction; China; disordered eating; gender identity; gender-diverse; physical and mental health; weight bias internalization","Adolescent; Adult; Body Dissatisfaction; Body Dysmorphic Disorders; Body Image; Body Mass Index; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; East Asian People; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Gender Identity; Health Status; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Weight Prejudice; Young Adult; adult; age; aging; anxiety; Article; behavior; body dissatisfaction; body mass; body weight; causality; Chinese; cross-sectional study; decision making; depression; eating; eating disorder; emotional stress; female; gender; gender identity; human; internal consistency; male; mental health; physiological stress; prevalence; psychometry; questionnaire; reliability; risk factor; sexual and gender minority; shame; transgender; weight bias; adolescent; body dysmorphic disorder; body image; China; East Asian; eating disorder; ethnology; gender identity; health status; mental stress; psychology; sexual and gender minority; weight bias; young adult","","","","","Shenzhen College Stability Support Plan, (2022年度深圳市高等院校稳定资助项目); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, (2023SC0028); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality","Jinbo He was supported by the 2022 Shenzhen College Stability Support Plan (2022\u5E74\u5EA6\u6DF1\u5733\u5E02\u9AD8\u7B49\u9662\u6821\u7A33\u5B9A\u8D44\u52A9\u9879\u76EE) from Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission (2023SC0028).

The current study evaluated which emotions (i.e., distress, fear, and moral emotions) were most strongly linked to feeling fat and tested feeling fat as a longitudinal mediator of the relationship between these emotions and restricting or binge eating (https://osf.io/3d5cq/). Method: Community adults (N = 714, M[SD] age = 41.5[13.7], 84.6% female, 85.9% white) provided data at baseline, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up. Relative weights analysis examined which emotion categories exhibited the strongest longitudinal relationships with feeling fat. Cross-lagged panel models tested feeling fat as a mediator of the relationship between emotions and eating disorder behaviors. Results: Distress and moral emotions were the strongest emotional predictors of feeling fat. Feeling fat predicted binge eating (p's < 0.001), but not restricting (p's ≥ 0.832), in random effects cross-lagged panel models. Feeling fat partially mediated the longitudinal relationship between distress and binge eating (p = 0.044); however, this effect became nonsignificant after adjusting for BMI (p = 0.354). Feeling fat did not mediate relationships between moral emotions and binge eating or between either distress or moral emotions and restricting (p's ≥ 0.638). Discussion: Feeling fat was associated with binge eating, not restricting, highlighting the importance of specificity in maintenance models. Because the mediating effect of feeling fat was accounted for by body size, factors associated with body size, such as internalized weight stigma, may be more relevant mediators of the relationship between negative emotions and eating disorder behaviors. Future research on feeling fat should adjust for body size. © 2024 The Author(s).

Yet, the literature is predominantly focused on caregivers of cisgender girls and women. This study assessed caregiver accommodation and self-efficacy in families of youth across gender who were in treatment for an eating disorder. Method: The sample included caregivers of cisgender boys (n = 20), cisgender girls (n = 18), and trans youths (e.g., transgender, gender diverse, and nonbinary; n = 5). We examined baseline differences in caregiver accommodation and self-efficacy, and also assessed treatment-related changes of these caregiver factors. Results: Accommodating behaviors at baseline were higher in caregivers of cisgender girls than caregivers of cisgender boys. Caregiver self-efficacy increased over treatment, though this effect was only significant for caregivers of cisgender girls. Conclusions: Differences in caregiver factors across youth gender emerged, which may inform development of caregiver interventions for pediatric eating disorders, and adaptations that may need to be considered for caregivers of cisgender boys. © 2024 American Psychological Association","caregivers; eating disorders; gender; pediatric; self-efficacy","","","","","","Research Institute; BC Children’s Hospital Foundation; Schweizerische Anorexia Nervosa Stiftung, (40-14); Michael Smith Health Research BC, MSFHR, (HPI-2020-0710)","This study was supported by a grant from the Swiss Anorexia Nervosa Foundation (Grant 40-14).

Transfeminine youth, especially in Asian cultures, are understudied in this context. This study investigates eating disorder risks among Thai transfeminine youth and compares to cisgender females, focusing on the association with body dissatisfaction. This study aims to explore 3 objectives: (1) to assess and compare the prevalence of eating disorder risks between Thai transfeminine youth and cisgender females; (2) to examine the link between body dissatisfaction and eating disorder risks; (3) to identify risk factors associated with abnormal eating disorder screening outcomes. Method: This is a cross-sectional comparative study conducted between September 2021 and October 2022. The study questionnaire includes Thai version of the Eating Attitude Test-26 (EAT-26) to assess the risks of eating disorders and Thai version of the Body Image Concern Inventory (BICI) to assess body dissatisfaction. The questionnaire was distributed through social media platforms to transfeminine and cisgender females, aged 12–25 years. The correlation between eating disorder risks and body dissatisfaction was analyzed with linear regression, while the comparisons between transfeminine individuals and cisgender female groups were analyzed with Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results: The study included 241 transfeminine individuals and 388 cisgender females, median age 19.0 years (interquartile range [IQR] 18–21) and 18 years (IQR 16–20), respectively. Ninety (37.3%) transfeminine individuals had an EAT-26 score ≥ 20, suggesting concerns for dieting and eating behaviors, compared to 70 (18%) cisgender females (p < 0.001). Risk factors for EDs included obesity (odds ratio [OR] 3.22, confidence interval [CI] 1.36–7.6) and low income (OR 3.66, CI 1.59–8.4). Protective factors were negligible exercise (OR 0.24, CI 0.09–0.66), gender identity disclosure (OR 0.27, CI 0.1–0.77), and high levels of happiness (OR 0.85, CI 0.73–0.98). There is a significant correlation between the positive eating behavior screening and the body dissatisfaction scores. Conclusions: Transfeminine youths show significantly higher concerns about dieting, body weight, and eating behaviors than their cisgender females, highlighting the unique challenges they face. These results emphasize the needs for targeted screening, health care access for treatment and support for eating disorders in transfeminine youths. © The Author(s) 2024.","Eating disorder; Thai; Transfeminine Person; Transgender","","","","","","Tangerine clinic; Ratchadapiseksompotch Fund; Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, MDCU, (GA65/03); Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, MDCU","Funding text 1: The authors would like to extend our gratitude to the Tangerine clinic and the Buddy CU clinic for their assistance.; Funding text 2: Our study received financial support from Ratchadapiseksompotch Fund, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Grant No. GA65/03.

In the same way, transgender women need individualized attention. Transgender women are at greater risk of suffering heart attacks or ischemic accidents, among other diseases, and are also at greater risk of developing eating disorders, poorer weight control and poorer perception of their image. Hormone therapy for gender reaffirmation in trans women modifies their body composition, and may also increase the risk of suffering from some pathologies. The nutritional needs of cisgender women are different from those of men, and trans women also have special needs, which may depend on whether or not they follow hormone therapy. Dietary studies, although scarce, suggest that transgender women have poor dietary habits and lifestyle. It is necessary to deepen the study of the nutritional situation of the female group, considering its diversity, and to develop standards and references appropriate to each case that allow better attention to the needs of these groups.; Introducción: El colectivo femenino merece una especial atención debido a los diferentes requerimientos que tienen en comparación con el colectivo masculino. De la misma manera, se necesita atender de manera individualizada al colectivo transgénero. En concreto, las mujeres trans tienen más riesgo de sufrir infartos o accidentes isquémicos, entre otras enfermedades, y también tienen mayor riesgo de desarrollar trastornos del comportamiento alimentario y peor control de peso y percepción de su imagen. La terapia hormonal de reafirmación de género en mujeres trans modifica su composición corporal y también puede aumentar el riesgo de padecer algunas patologías. Las necesidades nutricionales de las mujeres cisgénero son diferentes a las de los varones, y también tienen necesidades especiales las mujeres trans, que pueden depender del seguimiento o no de un tratamiento hormonal. Los estudios dietéticos, aunque escasos, sugieren que las mujeres transgénero tienen unos hábitos dietéticos y un estilo de vida menos saludables. Es necesario profundizar en el estudio de la situación nutricional del colectivo femenino, atendiendo a la diversidad del mismo, y desarrollar estándares y referencias adecuadas a cada caso que permitan una mejor atención de las necesidades de estos colectivos.","Mujer.

The purpose of this study was to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of adults with ARFID seeking treatment at a tertiary care eating disorders program, and to describe the course and outcomes of treatment at three levels of care—inpatient, intensive outpatient, and outpatient individual therapy. Method: This retrospective chart review study examined the charts of 42 patients who received treatment for ARFID between April 2020 and March 2023. Following diagnostic assessment, patients were referred to either inpatient treatment, intensive outpatient treatment, or outpatient individual therapy. All three levels of care involved individual cognitive behaviour therapy. Inpatients typically transitioned to one of the outpatient treatments as part of a continuous care plan. We examined demographic and clinical characteristics, treatment length and completion, and changes in key indicators during treatment. Results: Patients were diverse with respect to demographics (e.g., 62% cisgender women; 21% cisgender men; 17% transgender, non-binary, or other gender) and comorbid concerns (e.g., 43% had neurodevelopmental disorders; > 50% had mood and anxiety disorders; 40% had posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]; 35% had medical conditions impacting eating/digestion). Most patients presented with more than one ARFID maintaining mechanism (i.e., lack of appetite/interest, sensory sensitivities, and/or fear of aversive consequences of eating). Treatment completion rates and outcomes were good. On average, patients showed significant improvement in impairment related to their eating disorder, and those who were underweight significantly improved on BMI and were not underweight at end of treatment. Discussion: These findings add to the literature by indicating that ARFID patients are commonly male or have diverse gender identities, and have high rates of neurodevelopmental, mood, anxiety, and gastrointestinal disorders. We also found high rates of PTSD. The findings show promise for treatment outcomes across the continuum of care. Next steps in ARFID treatment and research include incorporating ARFID-specific assessments into routine care, and ongoing research investigating the efficacy and effectiveness of treatments such as CBT-AR. © 2024, The Author(s).","ARFID;

Our team included middle school staff, students, and teachers, and university faculty and students. Team members had a diverse range of intersecting cis- and transgender, racial, sexuality, and disability identities. Specific steps to the research process included: (1) establishing team leads at each site to maintain a collaborative and non-hierarchical team structure; (2) bi-weekly advisory team meetings to establish program needs and discuss curriculum and implementation options; (3) a year-long youth co-design process to generate content ideas, pilot pieces of programming, and incorporate youth leadership through an equity lens; (4) inclusive program writing from members of socially marginalized groups; (5) program piloting to solicit feedback from teachers, facilitators, and students; and (6) collaboratively incorporating feedback. The resulting 8-session (6 hours total) Body Justice Project has both dissonance-based and media literacy foundations, with topics related to cultural appearance ideals, diet culture and non-diet nutrition, media and appearance pressure, and body autonomy. It is designed for in-class delivery to middle school students by trained college and youth co-facilitator teams. We emphasize guiding principles and lessons learned, along with next steps in implementation. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Adolescent; Body Image; Child; Community-Based Participatory Research;

They occur along a spectrum of disordered eating and compensatory weight management behaviors, and from low to high body weight. Psychiatric comorbidities are the norm. In contrast to other major psychiatric disorders, first-line treatments for FEDs are mainly psychological and/or nutrition-focused, with medications playing a minor adjunctive role. Patients, carers and clinicians all have identified personalization of treatment as a priority. Yet, for all FEDs, the evidence base supporting this personalization is limited. Importantly, disordered eating and related behaviors can have serious physical consequences and may put the patient's life at risk. In these cases, immediate safety and risk management considerations may at least for a period need to be prioritized over other efforts at personalization of care. This paper systematically reviews several key domains that may be relevant to the characterization of the individual patient with a FED aimed at personalization of management. These domains include symptom profile, clinical subtypes, severity, clinical staging, physical complications and consequences, antecedent and concomitant psychiatric conditions, social functioning and quality of life, neurocognition, social cognition and emotion, dysfunctional cognitive schemata, personality traits, family history, early environmental exposures, recent environmental exposures, stigma, and protective factors. Where possible, validated assessment measures for use in clinical practice are identified. The limitations of the current evidence are pointed out, and possible directions for future research are highlighted. These also include novel and emerging approaches aimed at providing more fine-grained and sophisticated ways to personalize treatment of FEDs, such as those that utilize neurobiological markers. We additionally outline remote measurement technologies designed to delineate patients’ illness and recovery trajectories and facilitate development of novel intervention approaches. © 2025 World Psychiatric Association.","anorexia nervosa; ARFID; binge eating disorder; bulimia nervosa; clinical characterization; Feeding and eating disorders; OSFED; personalization of management; precision medicine","fluoxetine; ghrelin; incretin; leptin; lisdexamfetamine; olanzapine; thyrotropin; thyroxine; abdominal pain; acceptance and commitment therapy; acrocyanosis; adulthood; amenorrhea; anemia; anorexia; anorexia nervosa; anxiety; Article; aspiration pneumonia; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; autism; automutilation; avoidant restrictive food intake disorder; bariatric surgery; behavior change; behavior therapy; behavioral addiction; binge eating disorder; bipolar disorder; bloating; body image; body mass; body weight; bone density; bone pain; borderline state; bradycardia; brain depth stimulation; bulimia; caloric intake; caregiver; Childhood Trauma Questionnaire; clinical practice; cognition; cognitive behavioral therapy; cognitive defect; comorbidity; compulsive buying; constipation; delay discounting; depression; developmental delay; disease classification; disease duration; disease severity; disgust; distress syndrome; drug therapy; dry skin; DSM-5; dysphagia; eating; eating disorder; ecological momentary assessment; electrolyte blood level; emotion; emotional abuse; emotionality; environmental exposure; epistaxis; ethnicity; extraversion; family history; family therapy; feeding; feeding disorder; food availability; food insecurity; food intake; gambling; gastrointestinal motility; genetic risk; gestational age; health literacy; heart arrhythmia; heart rate; homosexual female; hormone resistance; human; hypercholesterolemia; hypertension; hypochloremia; hypoglycemia; hypogonadism; hypokalemia; hyponatremia; hypoproteinemia; insulin resistance; intellectual impairment; intestine flora; laceration; loneliness; machine learning; major depression; malnutrition; medical decision making; mental deficiency; mental disease; mental stress; metabolic alkalosis; metabolomics; mood disorder; muscle strength; nerve cell plasticity; nervous system development; neurofeedback; neurosis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; obsessive compulsive disorder; osteoporosis; ovary polycystic disease; parotid gland; perfectionism; personality; personality disorder; personalized medicine; phobia; physical abuse; physical activity; pneumomediastinum; posttraumatic stress disorder; prevalence; psychiatry; psychoeducation; psychosis; psychotherapy; QT prolongation; quality of life; questionnaire; residential care; retching; risk factor; risk management; role playing; schizophrenia; seizure; semi structured interview; sexual abuse; sexual orientation; sleep disorder; social cognition; social competence; social interaction; social phobia; social psychology; social support; speech and language rehabilitation; stigma; stomach emptying; Stroop test; transgender; UCLA Loneliness Scale; underweight; vomiting; working memory","","fluoxetine, 54910-89-3, 56296-78-7, 59333-67-4, 57226-07-0; ghrelin, 304853-26-7; lisdexamfetamine, 608137-32-2, 608137-33-3, 819871-04-0; olanzapine, 132539-06-1, 221373-09-7, 221373-18-8; thyrotropin, 9002-71-5; thyroxine, 7488-70-2","","","Instituto de Salud Carlos III, ISCIII; National Institute for Health and Care Research, NIHR; AGAUR‐Generalitat de Catalunya; South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust; Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC; King's College London, KCL; AGAUR-Generalitat de Catalunya; Horizon 2020; UK Research and Innovation, UKRI; Medical Research Council, MRC, (MR/X030539/1); Medical Research Council, MRC; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (P20 GM134969); National Institutes of Health, NIH; Novo Nordisk Fonden, NNF, (NNF22OC0071010); Novo Nordisk Fonden, NNF; Medical Research Foundation, MRF, (MR/X03058X/1); Medical Research Foundation, MRF; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (MR/W002418/1); Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC; National Health and Medical Research Council, NHMRC, (2025665); National Health and Medical Research Council, NHMRC","Funding text 1: U.H.

Minority stress theory proposes sexual minority stressors (SMS; e.g. discrimination) related to marginalized statuses are culturally specific stressors that may explain engagement in these behaviors. However, little is known about daily SMS-DEB associations. We conducted a 14-day daily diary study of 321 U.S.-based sexual minority cisgender women ages 19–35 who were in a relationship with a woman. SMS were assessed using an 8-item daily measure of distal SMS (e.g. heard anti-LGBT talk, verbal harassment), and DEB with single items capturing dietary restraint, overeating, loss of control eating, and emotional eating. Multi-level models revealed on days when women experienced SMS, they were more likely to report dietary restraint and emotional eating, but not overeating or loss of control eating. Women who generally reported more frequent SMS were more likely to report all four DEB. There were no significant couple-level SMS-DEB associations. These findings expand our understanding of how SMS is associated with DEB in the daily lives of cisgender sexual minority women. Future studies are needed to explore the temporal sequencing of the associations. Findings may also help to inform the design of culturally tailored interventions aimed at reducing DEB among sexual minority women. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Adult; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Feeding Behavior; Female; Humans; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Stress, Psychological; Young Adult; adult; Article; body mass; daily life activity; demographics; eating disorder; ethnicity; feeding behavior; female; homosexual female; human; physiological stress; self report; sexual and gender minority; sexual orientation; stress theory; transgender; feeding behavior; mental stress; psychology; young adult","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, NIAAA, (R15AA020420); National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, NIAAA; National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, NIMHD, (R01MD012598, K23MD015092); National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, NIMHD; National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (F31 MH120982); National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH","Funding text 1: A portion of this manuscript was presented at the Society for Ambulatory Assessment virtual conference in June 2021.

Method: Data consisting of n = 414,299 college students' responses to the American College Health Association's National College Health Assessment between fall 2015 and spring 2019 were utilized for this study. Overall and stratified adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were used to assess the association between different facets of identity (i.e., race/ethnicity, gender identity, and sexual orientation) and probable EDs. Results: Among all, in our analytic sample, 7.15% reported a probable ED. Interactions between all three identity variables were significant, and thus stratified odds ratios were evaluated. Transgender men were significantly more likely to report probable ED than cisgender male peers within the following racial/ethnic groups: non-Hispanic White (aOR: 3.33; 95% CI: 2.79, 3.96; p <.0001), non-Hispanic Black (aOR: 3.29; 95% CI: 1.72, 6.28; p =.0003), Hispanic (aOR: 2.31; 95% CI: 1.55, 3.43; p <.0001), Asian or Pacific Islander (aOR: 2.19; 95% CI: 1.45, 3.30; p =.0002), Biracial or Multicultural (aOR: 3.36; 95% CI: 2.17, 5.22; p <.0001), and other (aOR: 4.19; 95% CI: 2.25, 7.79; p <.0001). Conclusions: This study underscores the importance of increasing our understanding of interactions between marginalized identities and the ways in which minority identity informs ED risk. Public significance: The impact of multiple marginalized identities on ED outcomes is not well understood. Our study expands on previous ACHA-NCHA studies by addressing identity intersectionality, looking at more than one identity at a time (i.e., specifically race/ethnicity, gender identity, and sexual orientation). Our results contribute unique risk profiles for students who identify with multiple marginalized groups. Further, they indicate that that these associations vary based on the compounded effect of the demographic factors considered. © 2023 The Authors.

Most research regarding healthcare experiences of trans people with EDs focuses on specialized treatment. This qualitative study explored the experiences of trans patients with ED symptoms in trans-affirming primary care, which offers clinical support for gender affirmation in the context of interpersonally gender-affirming primary care services. Twenty-two participants were recruited via social media to participate in focus groups (n = 5). Researchers utilized thematic analysis. Participants reported gender-affirming and non-affirming experiences, experienced unwelcome comments from providers regarding bodies and gender, encountered barriers to disclosing their ED symptoms, felt transition-related medical care supported recovery but did not always resolve their ED symptoms, felt they had to self-advocate, and wanted their providers to recognize them as whole people (beyond their ED and transness) who experience joy. Importantly, despite being trans-affirming, participants critiqued trans-affirming primary care as perpetuating weight stigma and binary gender norms. Participants recommended providers receive ED training, implement universal ED screening, and explore how sociocultural norms regarding weight and gender negatively impact trans health outcomes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Disordered eating; Eating disorder; Gender diversity; Health equity; Primary care; Trans-affirming care; Transgender; Weight stigma","Adult; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Focus Groups; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Primary Health Care; Qualitative Research; Social Stigma; Transgender Persons; adult; gender; health services; mental disorder; primary health care; symptom; Article; body size; body weight; eating disorder; happiness; health care access; health care delivery; health disparity; health service; human; mental health; patient care; primary medical care; qualitative research; self advocacy; social media; thematic analysis; transgender; weight stigma; adult; eating disorder; female; information processing; male; middle aged; primary health care; procedures; psychology; qualitative research; social stigma","","","","","","","Eating Disorders: A Guide to Medical Care, (2021); Primary care; Attia E., Guarda A.S., Prevention and early identification of eating disorders, JAMA, 327, 11, (2022); Austin A., Flynn M., Richards K., Hodsoll J., Duarte T.A., Robinson P., Kelly J., Schmidt U., Duration of untreated eating disorder and relationship to outcomes: a systematic review of the literature, Eur.

To address this gap in the literature, the present study, comprised of 148 transgender and nonbinary adults (Mage = 24.68, SD = 6.64), tested the associations among gender identity pride, body appreciation, and intuitive eating, controlling for demographics and minority stress variables. The study also tested body appreciation as a mediator in the cross-sectional association between gender identity pride and intuitive eating. Regression models indicated that greater gender identity pride was significantly associated with greater body appreciation, but not intuitive eating. Greater body appreciation was a significant mediator in the positive association between gender identity pride and intuitive eating. Findings support the significant role and relevance of examining gender identity pride as related to body appreciation and intuitive eating. Future research may determine the causal impact of gender identity pride on body image and eating behaviors in transgender and nonbinary populations. Clinicians may consider the positive role of gender identity pride when addressing body image and eating behaviors with their transgender and nonbinary clients. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Adult;

Most research on EE focuses on over-/under-eating in response to negative emotions, the former of which is related to higher weight and binge-spectrum eating disorder (ED) symptoms while the latter has been implicated in low weight and restrictive-only ED. Individuals endorsing both forms of negative EE are more impaired than those reporting unidirectional negative EE. Less is known about the influence of positive emotions on eating, in part due to a lack of self-report measures of positive over- and under-eating as separate constructs. The current study presents the development, including item reduction and initial factorial validity (primary aims) and convergent validity (secondary aims) of the Comprehensive Emotional Eating Scale (CEES), a four-factor measure of positive and negative over- and under-eating. The initial 134-item pool for the CEES was based on a review of extant emotional eating scales and emotion words from the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. The item pool was reduced and four factors identified using exploratory graphical analysis. The structure of the final set of 40 items was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. Convergent validity of the negative over- and under-eating scales was established using measures of body image-focused eating disorder and ARFID symptoms, and exploratory data on the correlates of positive over- and under eating were reported. The CEES showed preliminary evidence of factorial and convergent validity in a US-based convenience sample. It allows for classification on all four quadrants of emotional eating. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder; Binge eating; Emotional eating; Emotional overeating; Emotional undereating; Restrictive eating","Adolescent; Adult; Body Image; Eating; Emotional Eating; Emotions; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Feeding Behavior; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Self Report; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; adult; anxiety disorder; Article; Asian; avoidant restrictive food intake disorder; Black person; body image; body mass; Caucasian; comprehensive emotional eating scale; confirmatory factor analysis; convergent validity; depression; difficulties in emotion regulation scale; Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire; emotional eating; Emotional Eating Scale; exploratory research; female; gender nonbinary; Hispanic; human; major clinical study; male; obesity; people of mixed ancestry; Perceived Stress Scale; Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; preliminary data; reliability; self report; structure analysis; transgender; underweight; validation study; adolescent; diagnosis; eating; eating disorder; emotion; emotional eating; factor analysis; feeding behavior; middle aged; psychology; psychometry; questionnaire; reproducibility; validation study; young adult","","","","","University of South Alabama, USA","Payment of participant costs was provided by the University of South Alabama via startup funding for the senior author.

Method: We used 21 disorder categories provided by the diagnostic and statistical manual (DSM) to characterize diagnoses among primary care (PC) patients. For each patient, we generated counts of unique disorder categories present during the PC encounter or in the year prior. We used these counts to generate multiple indexes, which we compared in a 60% training sample of our population. Using model fit statistics generated from ordered multinomial logistic regressions, we identified the subset of DSM categories which, structured as index, were most predictive of MHSUD hospitalization and death. We validated and fine-tuned the form of the selected index in the full population using measures of calibration and discrimination. Results: In model development, the index (I-6) which best fit the data (R2 = 0.191) included the following six disorder categories: substance use, depressive, psychotic, bipolar, trauma, and personality. When applied in the full population and weighted by disorder severity, this index demonstrated good predictive discrimination for MHSUD death (C = 0.66) and hospitalization (C = 0.88) and was well calibrated in comparisons of observed versus predicted outcomes. Conclusions: We recommend the I-6 as a parsimonious and effective tool for MHSUD burden risk adjustment. © 2023","Administrative data uses; Mental health; Risk adjustment for health outcomes; VA healthcare system","Hospitalization; Humans; Mental Health; Personality Disorders; Prognosis; Substance-Related Disorders; adult; anxiety disorder; Article; bipolar disorder; cohort analysis; depression; disease burden; drug dependence; eating disorder; ethnicity; female; gender dysphoria; human; major clinical study; male; mental health; obsessive compulsive disorder; paraphilic disorder; personality disorder; prevalence; prognosis; validation study; drug dependence; hospitalization; personality disorder","","","","","Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Rural Health; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, VA","Funding text 1: This work was funded as part of a grant from the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Rural Health, and we report no conflicts of interest.

Randomized control trials have demonstrated “rapid and robust antidepressant effects” of generic ketamine in individuals with treatment-resistant depression and bipolar depression. This paper assesses the medical safety of ketamine as a treatment for co-occurring treatment-resistant depression or bipolar depression in patients in higher levels of care for their eating disorders. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 104 patients receiving higher levels of care for their eating disorder and who had co-occurring treatment-resistant depression or bipolar disorder. Data on medical safety, particularly in the context of medical and nutritional instability, was collected and analyzed. The findings demonstrated that ketamine is a safe intervention for patients with eating disorders and co-occurring treatment-resistant depression or bipolar depression, even in cases where relative medical or nutritional instability was present due to disordered eating behaviors. This paper presents that ketamine can be used safely with medical monitoring in patents with co-occurring eating disorder and treatment-resistant depression or bipolar depression, despite the challenges posed by medical and nutritional instability in this patient population. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Antidepressive agents; Depression; Feeding and eating disorders; Ketamine; Malnutrition; Mood disorders","Adult; Antidepressive Agents; Bipolar Disorder; Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Humans; Ketamine; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult; antidepressant agent; esketamine; ketamine; mood stabilizer; neuroleptic agent; antidepressant agent; ketamine; adolescent; adult; anorexia nervosa; Article; avoidant restrictive food intake disorder; binge eating disorder; bipolar depression; blood cell count; body mass; bulimia; comprehensive metabolic panel; demographics; disease severity; drug safety; eating disorder; female; gender nonbinary; heart rate; human; major clinical study; male; malnutrition; patient care; patient monitoring; respiration depression; retrospective study; schizophrenia; systolic blood pressure; transgender and gender nonbinary; treatment resistant bipolar depression; treatment resistant depression; bipolar disorder; complication; drug therapy; eating disorder; epidemiology; middle aged; treatment resistant depression; young adult","","esketamine, 33643-46-8, 33643-47-9; ketamine, 1867-66-9, 6740-88-1, 81771-21-3; Antidepressive Agents, ; Ketamine, ","","","","","Alshammari T.K., The ketamine antidepressant story: new insights, Molecules, 25, 23, (2020); Treatment of patients with eating disorders,third edition.

Thus, this study examined: 1) the prevalence of attempts to lose, gain, or maintain the same weight across gender identities, 2) purposes of weight change attempts, and 3) relationships between weight change attempts and ED and MD symptoms across cisgender men, women, and transgender and gender expansive (TGE) youth. 940 adolescents and young adults (57.4% cisgender women, 33.8% cisgender men, 8.8% TGE) completed questionnaires about weight change attempts, ED and MD symptoms. Women and TGE individuals attempted to lose weight more often than men, while men attempted to gain weight more often. All genders endorsed weight loss and gain attempts for different purposes. Weight loss attempts related to ED symptoms and appearance intolerance, whereas weight gain attempts related to MD symptoms across genders. In women, all weight change attempts related to greater functional impairment due to exercise. Findings highlight the need for tailored interventions to address desires to change one’s body and underscore the harmful effects of weight change attempts across genders. © 2024 Taylor & Francis.","","Adolescent; Adult; Body Dysmorphic Disorders; Body Image; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Humans; Male; Sex Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Weight Gain; Weight Loss; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; body dysmorphic disorder; body image; body weight gain; body weight loss; eating disorder; female; human; male; psychology; questionnaire; sex factor; young adult","","","","","","","Allison P.D., Missing data, The Sage handbook of quantitative methods in psychology, pp. 72-89, (2009); Amodeo A.L., Esposito C., Antuoni S., Saracco G., Bacchini D., Muscle dysmorphia: What about transgender people?, Culture, Health & Sexuality, 24, 1, pp. 63-78, (2022); Benjamini Y., Hochberg Y., Controlling the false discovery rate: A practical and powerful approach to multiple testing, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B (Methodological), 57, 1, pp. 289-300, (1995); Bo S., Zoccali R., Ponzo V., Soldati L., De Carli L., Benso A., Fea E., Rainoldi A., Durazzo M., Fassino S., Abbate-Daga G., University courses, eating problems and muscle dysmorphia: Are there any associations?, Journal of Translational Medicine, 12, 1, (2014); Brown T.A., Forney K.J., Pinner D., Keel P.K., A randomized controlled trial of the body project: More than muscles for men with body dissatisfaction, The International Journal of Eating Disorders, 50, 8, pp. 873-883, (2017); Brownstone L.M., Kelly D.A., Maloul E.K., Dinneen J.L., Palazzolo L.A., Raque T.L., Greene A.K., “It’s just not comfortable to exist in a body”: Transgender/gender nonbinary individuals’ experiences of body and eating distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, Psychology of Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity, 9, 4, pp. 434-445, (2022); Carey M., Kupeli N., Knight R., Troop N.A., Jenkinson P.M., Preston C., Eating disorder examination questionnaire (EDE-Q): Norms and psychometric properties in U.K. females and males, Psychological Assessment, 31, 7, pp. 839-850, (2019); Carrard I., Kruseman M., Marques-Vidal P., Desire to lose weight, dietary intake and psychological correlates among middle-aged and older women.

This study aimed to establish community norms for the Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory (EPSI) among TGD adults (Forbush et al., 2013). The sample included 1206 gender-diverse people, 599 transgender men, and 293 transgender women from The PRIDE Study, a national longitudinal cohort of sexual and gender minority adults in the United States. We report mean scores, standard deviations, medians, interquartile ranges, and percentile ranks for the eight EPSI scales within TGD populations. Transgender women exhibited significantly higher scores on the Cognitive Restraint, Excessive Exercise, and Negative Attitudes Toward Obesity scales compared to transgender men and gender-diverse people. Conversely, transgender men showed significantly higher scores on the Muscle Building scale relative to transgender women and gender-diverse people. These findings suggest distinct patterns of eating pathology symptoms among TGD individuals and emphasize the need for clinicians to consider gender identity when assessing eating disorder symptoms. © 2025 The Authors","Eating disorders; Gender-diverse individuals; LGBTQ+; Norms; Transgender and gender-diverse health; Transgender health","adult; Article; attitude to health; body dissatisfaction; cognitive restraint; cohort analysis; eating disorder; eating disorder assessment; eating pathology symptom inventory; excessive exercise; exercise; feeding behavior; female; gender diversity; gender identity; human; LGBTQIA+ people; longitudinal study; male; public health; self concept; sexual and gender minority; social norm; sociodemographics; transgender and gender nonbinary; United States","","","","","Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo, ANID; National Institutes of Health, USNIH; Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, USUHS; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDECYT, (11240740); Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDECYT; National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (R61MH133710); National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH; Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, PCORI, (PRN-1501-26848); Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, PCORI","EJC was supported by the Chilean National Agency for Research and Development (FONDECYT N\u00B0 11240740).

However, this research has mostly been conducted with binary transgender people. Here, we examine how non-binary people experience and relate to their bodies. Semi-structured one-on-one interviews were conducted with 13 gender non-binary individuals living in Australia. Photo elicitation techniques were utilised, and the transcribed interview data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Six themes were identified: Expansive Understandings of Body Image, Body Image can be Linked to Gender Dysphoria, Cultivating a Preferred Body can Lead to Gender Euphoria, Appreciating Diversity in Non-Binary Body Ideals, The Androgynous Body Ideal is not Universally Accepted, and Experiencing the Body as Functional rather than Aesthetic. The present findings highlight the diversity of experiences of body image for non-binary people. The non-binary concept of body image was found to be expansive, stressing various physical attributes involved in social gender recognition and physiological sources of gender dysphoria. Some participants valued gender-affirming medical intervention, others were accepting of their bodies as they are, attributing their body confidence to the process of affirming their non-binary gender. © 2024 The Authors","Body concerns; Body image; Gender diverse; LGBT; Non-binary; Transgender","Adult; Australia; Body Image; Female; Gender Dysphoria; Gender Identity; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Qualitative Research; Self Concept; Transgender Persons; Young Adult; adult; Australia; body image; female; gender dysphoria; gender identity; human; male; middle aged; psychology; qualitative research; self concept; transgender; young adult","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (DE230101636); Australian Research Council, ARC","Joel Anderson was supported by funding from the Australian Research Council (DE230101636).

To address these gaps, Canada’s first child psychiatry access program, BC Children’s Hospital Compass Program, was developed in 2018 to support providers across the province in providing evidence-based mental health and substance use care to youth under 25. This article describes the program’s first five years and provides an overview of its creation, utilization, and clinical uses. Methods Quantitative data collected by the Compass Program from September 2018 through September 2023 were analyzed. Participation and utilization of the service by providers in the province were analyzed and descriptive statistics, including means with standard deviations for quantitative variables have been used to describe demographic and other medical factors related to participants. Findings A total of 2336 new providers have been enrolled since Compass’ inception. Number of clinical calls into Compass remained steady over the five-year period with an average of 1085 individual providers served per year. Service use is highest in Vancouver Coastal Region (27.3%), followed by Northern Health (21.4%), Interior (15.7%), Vancouver Island (14.5%), and Fraser (13.4%), and Yukon (0.3%). General practitioners make up over a third of all encounters (34.6%), followed closely by pediatrician encounters making up 27.5% of total encounters from 2018–2023. These two provider types comprise over 60% of all encounters over the 5-year timespan. Encounters with other provider types were less common, with the third most common encounter being Child and Youth Mental Health (CYMH) clinicians, totalling 8.6% of total encounters. 37.6% of encounters were for male patients and 42.9% for female patients with 6.8% reporting “Other” genders and 12.7% declining to answer. Medication concerns are the most common reason for accessing Compass, regardless of gender. Therapy questions, resource coordination issues, and diagnostic clarification followed in frequency, comprising a similar amount of consults. Compass consultations have the potential to benefit three groups of people: the specific patient being consulted on, the provider requesting the consultation, as well as the provider’s colleagues who might benefit from peer consultation. Conclusions Capacity building is important given Compass receives calls from rural and remote areas where there are no psychiatrists or child psychiatrists where general practitioners and clinicians regularly work with patients along the entire spectrum of mental health and substance use disorders. © 2025 Tsang et al.

Methods: Electronic medical records from nine healthcare systems participating in the Mental Health Research Network were aggregated to form a retrospective case–control study, with ICD-9 codes used to identify diagnoses in the 1 year prior to death by suicide for cases (N = 3330) or matching index date for controls (N = 297,034). Conditional logistic regression was used to assess differences in cancer and psychiatric diagnoses between cases and controls, controlling for sex and age. Results: Among patients without concurrent psychiatric diagnoses, cancer at disease sites with lower average 5-year survival rates were associated with significantly greater relative risk, while cancer disease sites with survival rates of >70% conferred no increased risk. Patients with most psychiatric diagnoses were at higher risk, however, there was no additional risk conferred to these patients by a concurrent cancer diagnosis. Conclusion: We found no evidence of a synergistic effect between cancer and psychiatric diagnoses. However, cancer patients with a concurrent psychiatric illness remain at the highest relative risk for suicide, regardless of cancer disease site, due to strong independent associations between psychiatric diagnoses and suicide. For patients without a concurrent psychiatric illness, cancer disease sites associated with worse prognoses appeared to confer greater suicide risk. © 2022 The Authors.

The purpose of this study was to provide initial evidence for the internal consistency and convergent validity of the Sick, Control, One Stone, Fat, Food (SCOFF) in a sample of transgender youth. Two hundred eight participants completed the SCOFF as part of a routine screening protocol. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were used to establish the factor structure of the SCOFF in this sample. Relationships between the SCOFF, Adolescent Binge Eating Disorder (ADO-BED), Nine-Item Avoidant/Restrictive Intake Disorder (NIAS), Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), and demographic characteristics were explored. The SCOFF was significantly related to all convergent validity variables, with moderate correlations with other eating disorder scales (ADO-BED and NIAS). The SCOFF is a valid measure to screen for eating disorders among transgender youth and young adults. © The Author(s) 2023.","anorexia nervosa; bulimia nervosa; eating disorder; screening; transgender","Adolescent;

In conjunction, sexual minority (SM; i.e., not exclusively heterosexual) college students may be at increased risk of engaging in alcohol misuse and disordered eating compared to their heterosexual peers due to exposure to minority stress. However, little research has examined whether engagement in FAD differs by SM status. Body esteem (BE) is an important resilience factor among SMs that may influence SM students' risk of participating in FAD. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to understand the association between SM status and FAD with additional interest in BE as a moderating factor. Participants were 459 college students who engaged in past 30-day binge drinking. Most participants identified as White (66.7 %), female (78.4 %), heterosexual (69.3 %), with a mean age of 19.60 (SD = 1.54) years. Participants completed two surveys (3 weeks apart) over the course of an academic semester. Analyses revealed a significant interaction between SM status and BE, such that SMs with lower BE (T1) reported more engagement in FAD-intoxication (T2), whereas SMs with higher BE (T1) reported less engagement in FAD-calories (T2) and FAD-intoxication (T2) than their heterosexual peers. Stressors associated with body esteem may contribute to increased FAD engagement among SM students. Consequently, BE may be an especially important target for interventions aimed at reducing FAD among SM college students. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Alcohol; Body esteem; College students; Food and alcohol disturbance;

While associations of obesity and gender diversity have been identified, rates of gender diversity among adolescents with obesity remain unclear. The aim was to examine gender diversity among adolescents with obesity in a weight management programme. A single-centre cross-sectional questionnaire study was conducted. Eligible adolescents received the Gender Identity/GD Questionnaire for Adolescents and Adults (GIDYQ-AA), a validated instrument measuring gender diversity and GD. Gender identities, sexual orientations, questionnaire scores, and frequency of GD (GIDYQ-AA score <3) were determined. The relationship of GIDYQ-AA scores and BMI Z-score (BMIz) was assessed. Of 72 consenting youth, 29 assigned females (AF) and 17 assigned males (AM) completed GIDYQ-AA and demographic questions. Seventeen (59%) AF reported non-heterosexual orientations, and 6 (21%) reported non-cisgender identities. One (6%) AM reported non-cisgender identity. Two (4%) AF individuals had GD based on GIDYQ-AA scores. GIDYQ-AA scores did not correlate with BMIz. In conclusion, adolescents with obesity, particularly AF with non-heterosexual orientation, reported high rates of non-cisgender identity and GD. Routine screening for gender-related concerns in weight management settings may be warranted. © 2024 The Authors.

Less is known about the impact on gender-affirming care and ED symptoms. This study aimed to expand on extant research and describe ED symptoms in TGD youth seeking gender-affirming care while exploring potential associations between gender-affirming hormone use and ED symptoms. A total of 251 TGD youth completed the Eating Disorders Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q) as part of routine clinical care. ANCOVAs and negative binomial regressions examined differences in ED symptoms among transgender females (identifying as female but assigned male at birth) and transgender males (identifying as male but assigned female at birth). ED severity was not significantly different among transgender females versus transgender males, (p =.09), or associated with gender-affirming hormone use (p =.07). Transgender females receiving gender-affirming hormones reported a greater proportion of objective binge eating episodes compared to those who were not (p =.03). Over a quarter of TGD youth reported engagement in ED behaviors suggesting assessment and intervention related to ED behaviors among TGD youth is imperative since adolescence is a particularly vulnerable period for adolescents and engagement in ED behaviors could lead to full ED development and medical risk. © The Author(s) 2023.","Eating disorders;

We assessed mental health problems among Finnish youth before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic using nationwide population-based samples. Our aim was to examine in which direction the heightened levels of adolescent mental health problems have developed after the pandemic. Methods: In this national, repeated cross-sectional, population-based study in Finland, we recruited students at lower and upper secondary level (aged 13–20 years) who were taking part in the Finnish School Health Promotion (SHP) survey in 2015–23 (119 681–158 897 participants per round). The SHP is based on total sampling and conducted biennially between March and May. Self-reports covered the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale; the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire for depression; the Mini Social Phobia Inventory for social anxiety; the Short Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale for mental wellbeing; loneliness; the Sick, Control, One Stone, Fat, Food measure for disordered eating; and suicidality (suicidal ideation, deliberate self-harm, and suicide attempts). Scales were dichotomised using validated cutoffs. Presence of any and comorbid mental health problems was assessed. Logistic (for dichotomised outcomes) and linear (for Short Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale) mixed effects models were used to analyse the effect of survey year on mental health, controlling for sociodemographic background factors and stratified by gender and school level. Cisgender and transgender youth were compared. Findings: Between 2015 and 2023, the SHP study recruited 722 488 students (371 634 [51·6%] girls and 348 857 [48·4%] boys) with a mean age of 15·8 years (SD 1·3) who were either in the eighth and ninth grades of comprehensive school or the first and second years of general and vocational upper secondary schools in Finland. The proportion of participants with generalised anxiety, depression, and social anxiety symptoms above the cutoff increased from pre-COVID-19 levels to 2021 and remained at these higher levels in 2023 among all study groups. Among girls in lower secondary education, prevalence of generalised anxiety, depression, and social anxiety symptoms increased from 2021 to 2023, as did social anxiety among girls in upper secondary education. Among boys, the proportion with social anxiety symptoms decreased between 2021 and 2023. Mental wellbeing scores decreased in all groups between 2021 and 2023, and disordered eating increased in girls, and in boys in lower secondary education. Suicidality increased in girls but not in boys. Loneliness was the only measure to show improvement in all groups from 2021 to 2023. In 2023, 55 895 (72·6%) of 76 994 girls and 22 718 (32·8%) of 69 205 boys reported at least one mental health problem, and 37 250 (48·4%) girls and 9442 (13·6%) boys reported comorbid mental health problems. Among both transfeminine and transmasculine youth, the prevalence of generalised anxiety and depression symptoms decreased from 2021 to 2023, but compared with cisgender youth, the proportions were significantly higher throughout. Interpretation: The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth mental health could be long lasting. In this study, the substantial change for the better among transgender youth was a positive exception. Providing adequate support and treatment for young people with poor mental health is essential, but solutions to the mental health crisis need to address a wider societal perspective and should be developed in partnership with young people.

Suicide encompasses different phases, but for CSA survivors the salient factors precipitating suicide are rarely studied. In this study, from a progressive perspective of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB), we aim to identify distinct risk factors for predicting different stages of STB, i.e., suicidal ideation (SI), suicide plan (SP), and suicide attempt (SA), among young adults with CSA experience. Based on mental health profiles of 4,070 young adult CSA survivors from a cross-sectional survey, we constructed five random forest classification models to respectively classify high suicidality, SI, SP, and SA. The common crucial factors for predicting SI, SP, and SA included NSSI and depression. The special important predictors for SI included OCD, anxiety, PTSD, and social rhythm. Co-occurrence of other types of childhood abuse and traumatic events was a special important predictor for SP among participants with SI. Self-compassion was the most crucial factor in classifying SA from those with SI. Social rhythm, co-occurrence of other types of childhood abuse, domestic violence, fear of happiness, and self-compassion made specific contribution to the prediction of SI, SP, and SA. However, the random forest model failed to accurately classify SA from those with SP, which was consistent with existing research. Our findings highlighted the importance of identifying suicidal characteristics for specified interventions at different stages of suicide for young people with CSA experiences. © The Author(s) 2025.","","Adolescent; Adult; Adult Survivors of Child Abuse; Child; Child Abuse, Sexual; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Risk Factors; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide; Suicide, Attempted; Young Adult; adult; alcohol consumption; anxiety; Article; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; autism; child neglect; child sexual abuse; controlled study; cross-sectional study; cyberbullying; decoding; depression; eating disorder; emotional abuse; emotional neglect; female; gender dysphoria; happiness; help seeking behavior; human; machine learning; major clinical study; male; obsessive compulsive disorder; physical abuse; posttraumatic stress disorder; random forest; self compassion; social phobia; sociodemographics; suicidal ideation; suicide attempt; undergraduate student; vulnerable population; young adult; adolescent; child; child abuse survivor; machine learning; psychology; risk factor; suicide","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (82201708); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2025A1515011554); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province; South China Normal University, SCNU, (ZD153); South China Normal University, SCNU; Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China, (23YJA190014); Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China NSFC NO. 82201708, GuangDong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2025A1515011554), the Striving for the First-Class, Improving Weak Links and Highlighting Features (SIH) Key Discipline for Psychology in South China Normal University, the National Natural Science Foundation of China NSFC No. 20&ZD153, and the Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Science Fund Project 23YJA190014.

Study Design: A retrospective database review. Setting: An equal-access, integrated health care system. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of Kaiser Permanente Northern California patients who underwent FFS from 2016 to 2021 on utilization of mental health services in a large integrated health care system. Full FFS was defined as all 3 facial thirds. We compared average quarterly utilization for 12 to 24 months before FFS with quarterly utilization during 12 to 24 months of follow-up. Patients who did not have continuous coverage for at least 12 months before and 12 months after FFS were excluded. Results: A total of 699 FFS cases were performed between 2016 and 2021, of which 478 cases were included (35.6 ± 12.3 years old, 207 [43.3%] had full FFS). Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests comparing pre-FFS and post-FFS utilization counts showed statistically significant reductions in the number of mental health-associated visits. Age and comorbid mental health diagnoses were significant predictors of mental health resource utilization in the pre-FFS period. A comorbid mood or anxiety disorder was a predictor of changes in resource utilization following FFS. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this endeavor is the first utilization study of FFS conducted in the United States. FFS was associated with significantly lower utilization of mental health services in the 12-month post-FFS period compared to the 12-month pre-FFS period. © 2025 American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation.","facial feminization surgery;

Assessment of treatment impact has been based on the assumption that without intervention, BMD Z-scores remain stable. However, the natural course of BMD in this population is unknown. Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study. Methods: Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans prior to medical intervention were included from 333 individuals assigned male at birth (AMAB) and 556 individuals assigned female at birth (AFAB) aged 12-25 years. The relationship between age and BMD Z-scores of sex assigned at birth was analysed for the lumbar spine (LS), total hip (TH), femoral neck (FN), and total-body-less-head (TBLH), adjusted for height SDS, height-adjusted lean mass Z-score, and whole body percentage fat Z-score. Results: In individuals AMAB, the BMD Z-score was negatively associated with age between 12 and 22 years: LS -0.13/year (95% confidence interval, CI -0.17; -0.10); TH -0.05/year (95% CI -0.08; -0.02); FN -0.06/year (95% CI -0.10; -0.03); and TBLH -0.12/year (95% CI -0.15; -0.09). Adjusting for height-adjusted lean mass Z-score attenuated the association at the LS and TBLH and eliminated the association at the TH and FN. BMD Z-scores and age were not associated between 22 and 25 years. In individuals AFAB, BMD Z-scores were only associated with age at the TBLH (-0.08/year, 95% CI -0.12; -0.04) between age 12 and 20 years. Conclusion: In individuals AMAB aged 12-22 years prior to any treatment, BMD Z-scores were inversely correlated with age. This could imply that BMD increases less in individuals AMAB than in the general population, and that changes in Z-score during puberty suppression and subsequent hormone supplementation are not necessarily due to treatment, but possibly related to lifestyle factors. © 2024 The Author(s).","bone density;

Method: Open text (survey) responses of Dutch and Flemish SGM emerging adults (n = 187) were thematically analysed using the constant comparative comparison method for qualitative analysis. Results: We identified 8 themes in our qualitative analysis. Two themes fell within the scope of the minority stress framework that has received little attention: (1) concerns about relationships and family planning and (2) feeling different (internal stressor). Two additional themes emerged largely beyond the scope of existing minority stress framework studies on suicidality: (3) SGM-related questioning; (4) negativity in LGBT communities. Four established minority stress framework themes emerged: (5) gender identity stress; (6) victimization; (7) coming-out stress; (8) psychological difficulties linked to SGM status. Conclusion: Suicide prevention needs to focus on supporting SGM emerging adults who worry about feeling “different”, or who have concerns over their romantic and family life, on reducing gender minority stress, as well as on caring for those who are victimized due to their sexual or gender identity. © The Author(s) 2023.","emerging adults; minority stress; sexual/gender minorities; suicidal ideation","Adult; Emotions; Female; Gender Identity; Humans; Male; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Sexual Behavior; Suicidal Ideation; adult; Article; childhood trauma; comparative study; coping behavior; demographics; depression; eating disorder; educational status; family life; family planning; fear; female; Flanders; gender identity; guilt; health care access; hormonal therapy; household income; human; human relation; income; intervention study; life stress; major clinical study; male; mental health; mood; Netherlands; physiological stress; qualitative analysis; questionnaire; self concept; sexual and gender minority; sexual orientation; suicidal ideation; suicide attempt; transgender; emotion; psychology; sexual behavior; suicidal ideation","","","","","","","Bolton S.L., Sareen J., Sexual orientation and its relation to mental disorders and suicide attempts: findings from a nationally representative sample, Can J Psychiatry, 56, 1, pp. 35-43, (2011); De Lange J., Baams L., van Bergen D.D., Bos H.M., Bosker R.J., Minority stress and suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among LGBT adolescents and young adults: a meta-analysis, LGBT Health, 9, 4, pp. 222-237, (2022); Arnett J.J., Adolescence and emerging adulthood: A cultural approach, (2010); Ferlatte O., Hottes T.S., Trussler T., Marchand R., Evidence of a syndemic among young Canadian gay and bisexual men: uncovering the associations between anti-gay experiences, psychosocial issues, and HIV risk, AIDS Behav, 18, 7, pp. 1256-1263, (2014); Meyer I.H., Prejudice, social stress, and mental health in lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations: conceptual issues and research evidence, Psychol Bull, 129, 5, (2003); Testa R.J., Habarth J., Peta J., Balsam K., Bockting W., Development of the gender minority stress and resilience measure, Psychol Sex Orientat Gend Divers, 2, 1, pp. 65-77, (2015); Klein A., Golub S.A., Family rejection as a predictor of suicide attempts and substance misuse among transgender and gender nonconforming adults, LGBT Health, 3, 3, pp. 193-199, (2016); Bockting W.O., Miner M.H., Swinburne Romine R.E., Et al., The transgender identity survey: a measure of internalized transphobia, LGBT Health, 7, 1, pp. 15-27, (2020); Lea T., de Wit J., Reynolds R., Minority stress in lesbian, gay, and bisexual young adults in Australia: associations with psychological distress, suicidality, and substance use, Arch Sex Behav, 2014, 43, pp. 1571-1578, (2017); Baams L., Grossman A.H., Russell S.T., Minority stress and mechanisms of risk for depression and suicidal ideation among lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth, Dev Psychol, 51, 5, (2015); Grossman A.H., D'Augelli A.R., Transgender youth and life-threatening behaviors, Suicide Life Threat Behavior, 37, 5, pp. 527-537, (2007); Grossman A.H., Park J.Y., Russell S.T., Transgender youth and suicidal behaviors: applying the interpersonal psychological theory of suicide, J Gay Lesbian Ment Health, 20, 4, pp. 329-349, (2016); Toomey R.B., Advancing research on minority stress and resilience in trans children and adolescents in the 21st century, Child Dev Perspect, 15, 2, pp. 96-102, (2021); Bailey L., Ellis S., McNeil J., Suicide risk in the UK trans population and the role of gender transitioning in decreasing suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, Mental Health Rev J, 19, 4, pp. 209-220, (2014); Turban J.L., King D., Carswell J.M., Keuroghlian A.S., Pubertal suppression for transgender youth and risk of suicidal ideation, Pediatrics, 145, 2, (2020); Cover R., Queer youth suicide, culture and identity: Unliveable lives?, (2016); DiStefano A.S., Suicidality and self-harm among sexual minorities in Japan, Qual Health Res, 18, 10, pp. 1429-1441, (2008); Rivers I., Gonzalez C., Nodin N., Peel E., Tyler A., LGBT people and suicidality in youth: a qualitative study of perceptions of risk and protective circumstances, Soc Sci Med, 212, (2018); McDermott E., Roen K., Scourfield J., Avoiding shame: young LGBT people, homophobia and self-destructive behaviours, Cult Health Sex, 10, 8, pp. 815-829, (2008); Scourfield J., Roen K., McDermott L., Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young people's experiences of distress: resilience, ambivalence and self-destructive behaviour, Health Soc Care Community, 16, 3, pp. 329-336, (2008); (2012); Van Bergen D.D., Bos H.M., van Lisdonk J., Keuzenkamp S., Sandfort T.G., Victimization and suicidality among Dutch lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths, Am J Public Health, 103, 1, pp. 70-72, (2013); Motmans J., Wyverkens E., Defreyne J., Being transgender in Belgium.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of internet overuse and psychiatric disorders in adolescents who applied to the child psychiatry outpatient clinic after the distance education period. Materials and Methods: A semi-structured tool, “Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version” (K-SADS-PL) was used to assess psychiatric diagnoses and Young Internet Addiction Test (IAT) to determine excessive internet usage. A total of 141 adolescents aged 11-18 years were recruited for this study. Results: The average score for IAT was statistically significantly higher in the youths with social anxiety disorder compared to those without (p=0.001) even after controlling for socioeconomic status (SES) (p=0.007). According to the hierarchical regression analyses, the girl gender (B=-6.899, p=0.029), younger age (B=-1.526, p=0.032) and co-morbidity of OCD (B=5.292, p=0.042) have statistically significantly predicted higher IAT scores in adolescents diagnosed with anxiety disorders. Conclusion: Identifying the common psychiatric diagnoses related to pathological internet use in adolescents, who started face-to-face education after a long break would enable mental health professionals to plan appropriate interventions for problematic areas particularly in vulnerable population more quickly when similar outbreaks recur. © 2023, Galenos Publishing House.

One way to enhance outcomes is to further our understanding of adolescent depression and improve our capacity to target the most frequently reported and problematic symptoms. A common but often neglected symptom of depression is fatigue, which is associated with considerable impairment and has the potential to interfere with adolescents’ engagement in psychological therapies. Despite this, the experience of fatigue in adolescent depression and how we target it in treatment is currently poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to explore adolescents’ experiences and understandings of fatigue in depression, recruiting from clinical and community settings. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 UK-based adolescents aged 14–18 years old with elevated symptoms of depression. Using reflexive thematic analysis, three themes were generated. Fatigue is a complex concept explored adolescents’ understanding of fatigue as a dynamic, multifaceted symptom which had mental and physical components. Trapped in a cycle of fatigue considered the complex and reciprocal relationship between fatigue and other depressive symptoms, and the subsequent impact of limited energy on engagement with everyday activities. Finally, stigma as a barrier to help-seeking highlighted how adolescents were reluctant to seek help due to experienced stigma and the perception that fatigue was not a serious enough symptom. Findings from this study suggest that fatigue should be viewed as a psychological as well as somatic symptom of depression, with implications regarding the identification and treatment of fatigue in depression in routine clinical practice. © The Author(s) 2023.","Adolescence; Depression; Fatigue; Lived experience; Qualitative","Adolescent; Depression; Fatigue; Female; Humans; Male; Qualitative Research; Social Stigma; United Kingdom; adolescent; adolescent depression; adult; anorexia nervosa; anxiety disorder; Article; Chalder Fatigue Scale; clinical article; clinician; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; fatigue; female; gender dysphoria; general practitioner; health care personnel; human; male; mental health service; pandemic; personal experience; posttraumatic stress disorder; qualitative research; self report; semi structured interview; social media; stigma; thematic analysis; young adult; depression; psychology; qualitative research; social stigma; United Kingdom","","","","","UK Research and Innovation, UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/P000630/1); Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC; National Institute for Health and Care Research, NIHR, (ICA-CDRF-2018-04-ST2-047, DRF-2016-09-021, 302367); National Institute for Health and Care Research, NIHR","This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [grant number ES/P000630/1].

The purpose of this study was to examine ED psychopathology among adolescents and young adults in Canada with diverse gender and sexual identities. Method: Data were collected from 2,714 Canadians, aged 16–30 years old, via an online survey at the end of 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants responded to sociodemographic questions (including history of EDs) and reported on eating attitudes and behaviors. Descriptive statistics and multiple modified Poisson and linear regressions were conducted. Results: Over half the sample was heterosexual, 35% were sexual minority cisgender men and women, and 6.5% were transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) people. The sample overall reported elevated ED psychopathology based on their eating attitudes and behaviors. TGNC participants reported the most severe ED psychopathology. Generally, sexual minority cisgender women and cisgender men had elevated ED psychopathology compared to their heterosexual counterparts. Regression analyses revealed all gender and sexual minorities reported greater ED psychopathology compared to heterosexual cisgender men. Discussion: The Canadian sample reported elevated ED psychopathology compared to previous studies among various populations. Additional investigations are now needed to observe how ED psychopathology continues to change after the onset of the pandemic. Further research is needed among cisgender men, TGNC people, and sexual minorities to understand the unique stressors they face that lead to high ED psychopathology, and develop appropriate prevention and treatment tools. Public significance: EDs affect people of all gender and sexual identities. People who identify as a gender and/or sexual minority often experience problematic eating attitudes and behaviors, particularly transgender and gender non-conforming people of all sexual identities. More research attention is needed among these populations, especially due to a paucity of research among Canadians, to develop effective diagnostic tools, prevention efforts, and treatment programs specific to gender and sexual identities. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","COVID-19; eating disorders; EDE-Q; gender minority; sexual minority","Adolescent; Adult; Canada; COVID-19; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Gender Identity; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Sexual and Gender Minorities; United States; Young Adult; adult; Article; body mass; Canada; Canadian; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; demography; eating disorder; Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire; feeding behavior; female; gender identity; heterosexuality; human; male; scoring system; sexual and gender minority; theoretical model; transgender and gender nonbinary; young adult; adolescent; eating disorder; gender identity; pandemic; sexual and gender minority; United States","","","","","University of Toronto, U of T, (512586)","This study was funded by the Connaught New Researcher Award at the University of Toronto (#512586).

Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of patients who initiated estradiol at an adolescent gender clinic between 2010 and 2019. Data on the route of estradiol administration and antiandrogen use (spironolactone or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist) were collected, and laboratory data were analyzed. Scatterplots were used to visualize the relationship between the estradiol dose and testosterone and estradiol laboratory values. Results: A total of 118 patients were included, with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 17.2 (1.6) years. The most common route of estradiol administration was oral only (62.7%), followed by transdermal only (23.7%), multiple routes excluding subcutaneous (8.5%), and any subcutaneous (5.1%). Notable variability was observed in the serum estradiol levels, with means (SDs) of 131.9 (120.4) pg/mL for those on oral estrogen 6 to 8 mg per day, 62.6 (40.3) pg/mL for those on transdermal estrogen 0.1 to 0.15 mg every 24 hours, and 53.6 (42.4) pg/mL for those on subcutaneous estradiol. In patients who received spironolactone, transdermal estradiol was associated with lower testosterone levels than estradiol administered orally or subcutaneously. Conclusion: Oral, transdermal, and subcutaneous administrations of estrogen all lead to increased serum estradiol levels and are effective for use in gender-affirming care for youth. Patients on transdermal estrogen tended to have lower serum estradiol levels but also had more suppression of serum testosterone levels. © 2023 AACE","estradiol; gender-affirming hormone therapy; gender-diverse youth; transgender youth","Adolescent; Estradiol; Estrogens; Humans; Retrospective Studies; Spironolactone; Testosterone; Transgender Persons; antiandrogen; estradiol; estrogen; gonadorelin agonist; histrelin; leuprorelin; spironolactone; estradiol; estrogen; testosterone; adolescent; adult; anxiety disorder; Article; body mass; depression; drug dose increase; eating disorder; female; gender affirming hormone therapy; hormone blood level; human; juvenile; laboratory test; LGBTQIA+ people; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; low drug dose; major clinical study; male; medical care; retrospective study; sociodemographics; testosterone blood level; transgender; young adult","","estradiol, 50-28-2; histrelin, 76712-82-8, 220810-26-4; leuprorelin, 53714-56-0, 74381-53-6, 944347-41-5; spironolactone, 52-01-7; testosterone, 58-22-0; Estradiol, ; Estrogens, ; Spironolactone, ; Testosterone, ","","","Seattle Children's Center for Pediatric Nursing Research; Seattle Children’s Center for Pediatric Nursing Research","Funding text 1: This work was funded by a grant from the Seattle Children's Center for Pediatric Nursing Research.

Moreover, to our knowledge, there has been no research describing disordered eating in Chinese transgender adults. Thus, this study aimed to explore group differences in and relationships between transgender congruence, body appreciation, body dissatisfaction, and disordered eating in Chinese transgender adults. Methods: This study examined transgender congruence, body appreciation, body dissatisfaction, and disordered eating in a sample of Chinese transgender adults (N = 200). Chi-square, F tests, and correlation analyses were conducted to examine group differences and relationships between study variables. Results: Of the transgender adults, 31.0% screened positive as probable eating disorder (ED) cases. There were no gender identity differences in the study variables. Transgender congruence was positively associated body appreciation (r =.40, p <.001) and negatively associated with body dissatisfaction (r = −.26, p <.001) and disordered eating (r = −.15, p =.031). Discussion: Chinese transgender adults may be at high risk of EDs. Transgender congruence and body appreciation may serve a protective role in the context of eating pathology in Chinese transgender adults. Future research is needed to validate the observed relationships between transgender congruence, body appreciation, body dissatisfaction, and disordered eating in Chinese transgender adults. Public Significance: Research on disordered eating and body image in Chinese transgender adults is limited. This study describes disordered eating and its relations with transgender congruence, body appreciation, and body dissatisfaction in Chinese transgender adults. Findings highlight the need for and implications of ED intervention in Chinese transgender adults. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","body appreciation; body dissatisfaction; Chinese transgender adults; disordered eating; transgender congruence","Adult; Body Dissatisfaction; Body Image; East Asian People; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Humans; Male; Transgender Persons; adult; age; Article; body dissatisfaction; body height; body image; body mass; body weight; Chinese; correlation analysis; eating disorder; educational status; employment status; female; gender identity; Han Chinese; human; major clinical study; male; marriage; medical research; obesity; risk assessment; self report; social status; transgender; young adult; body image; East Asian","","","","","Chinese University of Hong Kong, CUHK, (PF.01.001428); Chinese University of Hong Kong, CUHK","This research was supported by the Presidential Fund of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, to Jinbo He (Grant Number: PF.01.001428).

The purpose of this study was to examine associations between GD, ED, and mental health diagnoses among adolescents. Methods: Data were extracted from the electronic health records of 57,353 patients aged 9-18 seen at a single pediatric health system between 2009 and 2022. Adjusted logistic regression models tested for associations between GD, ED, and mental health diagnoses. Results: Youth with a GD diagnosis had significantly greater odds of also having an ED diagnosis compared to those without a GD diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.72, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.98–4.64). Among those with an ED diagnosis, youth with a GD diagnosis had significantly lower odds of having an anorexia nervosa diagnosis (aOR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.18–0.61) and significantly greater odds of having an unspecified or other specified ED diagnosis (aOR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.56–3.93) compared to those without a GD diagnosis. Youth with both GD and ED diagnoses had significantly greater odds of also having a diagnosis of anxiety (aOR = 24.01, 95% CI: 14.85–38.83), depression (aOR = 48.41, 95% CI: 30.38–77.12), suicidality (aOR = 26.15, 95% CI: 16.65–41.05) and self-harm (aOR = 35.79, 95% CI: 22.48–56.98) as compared to those with neither a GD nor an ED diagnosis. Discussion: Adolescents with co-occurring GD and ED diagnoses are at greater risk for anxiety, depression, suicidality, and self-harm as compared to youth with neither diagnosis. Further research is essential to understand the complex interplay of mental health concerns and EDs among gender diverse adolescents and to inform appropriate interventions. © 2024 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine","Adolescent;

Generally experienced in a cis-heteronormative context, this process is marked by stigma and discrimination and the social harms they can cause, including a higher-than-average prevalence of alcohol use. Objectives: To profile the alcohol use of sexually and gender diverse (SGD) youth from a life course perspective and to explore individual perceptions regarding the personal, social and cultural factors (including stigmatization and its consequences) modulating their consumption. Methodology: This qualitative descriptive study is grounded in symbolic interactionism. Semi-structured interviews lasting approximately 90 min were conducted with LGBTQ+ youth aged 18 to 30 using alcohol at least once a week. A thematic analysis was performed. Results: A total of 31 individuals aged 18–29 (average age: 25) were interviewed. The average score regarding alcohol use was 14.25 (Standard Deviation -SD-: 4–31), which corresponds to a moderate risk and indicates the need for a brief intervention. Our study documents how the higher alcohol use among LGBTQ+ youth is shaped by individual, community and cultural factors at different points in the queer life course. Among the factors influencing drinking are the emotions experienced when questioning sexual orientation and/or gender identity as well as the feelings resulting from stigma and discrimination. Our findings also indicate the influence of socializing in the queer community and meeting peers and partners, as well as that of LGBTQ+ cultural practices. Discussion: Our study indicates the need for grassroots-level interventions that work to mitigate social pressures in queer socialization contexts. Accordingly, any intervention, whether preventive or therapeutic, must consider the interplay of personal, social, community and cultural factors. Interventions regarding alcohol use must build on the strengths of community and the sense of belonging. © 2024 by the authors.","alcohol use; discrimination; LGBTQ+ youth; queer life course; stigma","Adolescent; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Female; Humans; Male; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Social Stigma; Young Adult; cultural influence; gender identity; gender issue; gender relations; gender role; homosexuality; perception; symbolism; young population; adult; alcohol consumption; anxiety; Article; bulimia; carcinogenesis; clinical article; conceptual framework; emotion; female; female to male transgender; gender dysphoria; gender identity; genetic discrimination; health behavior; homosexual female; human; interview; LGBTQIA+ people; lifespan; male; perception; prevalence; psychosis; qualitative research; questionnaire; religion; semi structured interview; sexual orientation; social aspect; social environment; social network; social phobia; social support; socialization; stigma; sugar intake; symbolic interactionism; thematic analysis; transgender; videoconferencing; adolescent; drinking behavior; psychology; sexual and gender minority; social stigma; young adult","","","NVivo 12 software, QSR International, Australia; SPSS Statistics 27 software, IBM, United States","IBM, United States; QSR International, Australia","Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR, (471393); Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR","This research was funded by Canadian Institutes of Health Research grant number 471393.","Eribon D., Réflexion Sur La Question Gay, (2012); Hammack P.L., The life course development of human sexual orientation: An integrative paradigm, Hum.

This scientific statement expands the Society's 2012 statement by focusing on endocrine disease disparities in the pediatric population and sexual and gender minority populations. These include pediatric and adult lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual (LGBTQIA) persons. The writing group focused on highly prevalent conditions - growth disorders, puberty, metabolic bone disease, type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D) diabetes mellitus, prediabetes, and obesity. Several important findings emerged. Compared with females and non-White children, non-Hispanic White males are more likely to come to medical attention for short stature. Racially and ethnically diverse populations and males are underrepresented in studies of pubertal development and attainment of peak bone mass, with current norms based on European populations. Like adults, racial and ethnic minority youth suffer a higher burden of disease from obesity, T1D and T2D, and have less access to diabetes treatment technologies and bariatric surgery. LGBTQIA youth and adults also face discrimination and multiple barriers to endocrine care due to pathologizing sexual orientation and gender identity, lack of culturally competent care providers, and policies. Multilevel interventions to address these disparities are required. Inclusion of racial, ethnic, and LGBTQIA populations in longitudinal life course studies is needed to assess growth, puberty, and attainment of peak bone mass. Growth and development charts may need to be adapted to non-European populations. In addition, extension of these studies will be required to understand the clinical and physiologic consequences of interventions to address abnormal development in these populations. Health policies should be recrafted to remove barriers in care for children with obesity and/or diabetes and for LGBTQIA children and adults to facilitate comprehensive access to care, therapeutics, and technological advances. Public health interventions encompassing collection of accurate demographic and social needs data, including the intersection of social determinants of health with health outcomes, and enactment of population health level interventions will be essential tools.  © 2023 The Author(s).

Methods: In this observational study, adolescents with epilepsy seen in a single center between 2013 and 2022 who had comorbid EDs were compared to two control groups of adolescents with only epilepsy and only EDs. Patients with intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorder were excluded. Data retrieved included demographic and anthropometric details and clinical variables relating to seizure types, EDs, and psychiatric disorders and behaviors. Results: A total of 376 subjects were included in the study: 84 adolescents with both epilepsy and eating disorders, 135 with only epilepsy, and 157 with only EDs. The rate of EDs in adolescents with epilepsy was 7.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.6%–8.5%) overall, 11.3% (95% CI 8.8%–14.3%) in females, and 3.1% (95% CI 1.9%–4.8%) in males. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) time difference between the onset of epilepsy to an ED was 1.6 (.5–3.6) years. Among adolescents with epilepsy, those with an ED were more likely to be female (p =.001) and have a lower body mass index z-score (zBMI) percentile (p <.001). Epilepsy type, seizure frequency, or seizure duration were not specific for having or not having EDs. Among adolescents with EDs, those with epilepsy had a younger onset of their EDs (p <.001), included relatively more males (p =.007), and consisted of more cases of anorexia-nervosa-restrictive type (p <.001), and fewer cases of bulimia nervosa (p =.04) and binge eating disorder (p =.003). Adolescents with epilepsy and a comorbid ED were more likely to have psychiatric comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, and suicidality than adolescents with only epilepsy or EDs. Significance: EDs should be suspected and screened for in intellectually intact female and male adolescents with epilepsy, irrespective of their epilepsy type. If disturbed eating behaviors or EDs are identified, further evaluation should be directed at detecting other psychopathologies, including suicidality. © 2023 International League Against Epilepsy.","adolescents: anorexia nervosa;

Mentalizing has been posited as a prerequisite for effective emotion regulation. The current study aims to examine the roles of epistemic trust and interpersonal problems in driving the association between mentalizing and emotion regulation, contrasting clinical and non-clinical populations. Method: A total of 652 individuals (296 clinical and 356 community control) were employed. Sequential mediation analysis was used to examine the role of epistemic stances and interpersonal problems in the mentalizing-emotion regulation link, and moderated mediation analysis was conducted to identify group differences in these pathways. Results: Ineffective mentalizing was associated with emotion dysregulation and interpersonal problems. Higher levels of epistemic credulity and mistrust were associated with ineffective mentalizing, interpersonal problems, and emotion dysregulation. Sequential mediation analysis indicated that disruptions in epistemic trust (epistemic mistrust and credulity) and interpersonal problems partially mediated the relationship between inadequate mentalizing and emotion dysregulation, with these pathways being consistent across both clinical and control groups. The pathways including epistemic trust were not significant. Limitations: The study's limitations include a simplified theoretical model, a cross-sectional design preventing causal inference, and sample recruitment methods possibly limiting generalizability. Conclusions: These findings suggest a potential mechanism connecting mentalizing, disruptions in epistemic trust, interpersonal problems, and emotion regulation, to illuminate a crucial aspect of psychological functioning. These results emphasize the significance of social-communicative aspect in clinical outcomes. © 2024 The Authors","Emotion; Epistemic trust; Interpersonal problems; Mentalizing; Psychopathology","Adult; Emotional Regulation; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Mediation Analysis; Mental Disorders; Mentalization; Middle Aged; Theory of Mind; Trust; Young Adult; adult; Article; body dysmorphic disorder; clinical feature; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; community sample; controlled study; correlational study; cross-sectional study; demographics; depression; difficulties in emotion regulation scale; eating disorder; emotion regulation; emotional disorder; epistemic trust; epistemic trust, mistrust and credulity questionnaire; female; generalized anxiety disorder; human; human relation; hypochondriasis; interpersonal conflict; inventory of interpersonal problems; major clinical study; male; mediation analysis; mental disease; mentalization; mentalizing questionnaire; mixed anxiety and depression; obsessive compulsive disorder; panic; path analysis; phobia; posttraumatic stress disorder; questionnaire; self report; sequential path analysis; social phobia; transgender; trust; human relation; middle aged; physiology; psychology; theory of mind; young adult","","","","","Turkiye's Ministry of National Education; National Education; Wellcome Trust, WT; National Institute for Health and Care Research, NIHR, (NF-SI-0514-10157); National Institute for Health and Care Research, NIHR; NIH-NIDS, (5R01NS092701-03)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Senior Investigator Award ( NF-SI-0514-10157 ) awarded to Peter Fonagy.

It has been suggested that early-life events may interact with biological predispositions, yet little research has explored specific early-life circumstances that might contribute to gender incongruence. One such factor is adoption, as a few pediatric gender identity clinics have reported an overrepresentation of adoptees. However, no study has systematically examined whether this trend extends to adult transgender health centers, nor has the psychosocial profile of adopted transgender individuals been characterized in adulthood. Aims and methods This retrospective study was conducted in two phases to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of adoptees among adult transgender patients seeking gender-affirming therapy. In Phase 1, we analyzed a cohort of 671 new adult subjects presenting between 2015 and 2021. In Phase 2, the nested case-control analysis, the 15 adoptees identified were matched in a 1:4 ratio with non-adopted controls based on age, assigned sex at birth, and presentation timing. Data on demographics, psychosocial factors, psychiatric diagnoses, and parental support were extracted from electronic records, and augmented by telephone interviews when needed. Results Adoptees constituted 2.2% of the clinic population, an order of magnitude higher than the national rate (P < 0.0001), with an unprecedented assigned-female-at-birth (AFAB) ratio of 73.3%. After matching, 60% of adoptees had at least one psychiatric co-morbidity, almost twice the rate of non-adopted controls (OR = 3.23, 95% CI: 1.02–10.21, P=0.042). Despite coming from higher socioeconomic status homes (P<0.001), adoptees had lower odds of achieving college education (P=0.031), and receiving full parental support for transition (OR=0.20, 95% CI: 0.05–0.71, P=0.015). Notably, 28.6% of adoptees had attempted suicide vs 3.3% of non-adopted controls (OR=11.6, 95% CI: 1.87–71.97, P=0.01). Conclusions Adopted transgender individuals represent a vulnerable subgroup within the transgender population, characterized by unique psychosocial challenges. Our findings underscore the importance of tailored interventions and heightened support within transgender health clinics for adoptees seeking gender-affirming therapy. Further research is warranted to elucidate the interplay of adoption, biological predispositions, and social factors in the development of gender incongruence. © 2025 Yaish et al.

Its prevalence in the child and adolescent population varies between 0,6-1,7 %, with a significant increase in recent years, observed both in Chile and internationally. The objective of this research is to describe sociodemographic characteristics and psychiatric comorbidity in Boys, Girls and Adolescents with GD in Chilean hospitals. Method: quantitative, descriptive and retrospective study. The sample was 38 patients under 18 years of age with GD. The variables were analyzed: sex, gender identity, age, age at diagnosis and prevalence of comorbidities, coded according to DSM-5 and ICD-10. The analysis of measures of central tendency and dispersion was carried out with PASW Statistics 18. Results: the average age at diagnosis was 14 years. 100 % had comorbidity, the most frequent being depressive episodes (68,4 %), attempted self-elimination (50 %) and eating disorder (34,2 %). An average of 2,8 comorbidities per subject was determined. 21,1 % of the subjects presented critical psychiatric multimorbidity (four simultaneous diagnoses). Conclusions: there is a high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities in adolescents with GD, highlighting mood disorders, anxiety, self-harming behaviors, suicide attempts and eating disorders, there being a need for a multidisciplinary approach that considers gender identity and serious comorbidities. © 2024; Los autores.","Gender Dysphoria; Mental Health; Psychiatric Comorbidity; Transgender","","","","","","","","Florence A, The Misuse of Gender Dysphoria:Toward Greater Conceptual Clarity in Transgender Health, Perspectives on Psychological Science, pp. 1-6, (2019); Manual diagnóstico y estadístico de los trastornos mentales, (2014); Jessen RS, Hebold Haraldsen IR, Stanicke E., Navigating in the dark: Meta-synthesis of subjective experiences of gender dysphoria amongst transgender and gender non-conforming youth, Social Science & Medicine, (2021); Seron T., Catalan M., Identidad de Género y Salud Mental, Rev Chil Neuro-Psiquiatría, 59, 3, pp. 234-247, (2021); Valadares L.

Background: Comprehensive analyses of psychosocial outcomes after gender-affirming FFS are absent in the literature resulting in a paucity of information on the impact of FFS on quality of life as well as ramifications in health insurance coverage of FFS. Methods: Scores from 11 validated, quantitative instruments from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) assessing anxiety, anger, depression, global mental health, global physical health, satisfaction with sex life, positive affect, emotional support, social isolation, companionship, and meaning and purpose. Patients within the preoperative group (pre-FFS) were evaluated >30 days before surgery and patients within the postoperative group (post-FFS) were evaluated ≥10 weeks after surgery. Results: A total of 169 patients [mean (SD) age, 33.5 (10.8) years] were included. Compared with the pre-FFS group (n=107), the post-FFS group (n=62) reported improved scores anxiety (56.8±8.8 vs 60.1±7.9, P=0.01), anger (47.4±7.6 vs 51.2±9.6, P=0.01), depression (52.2±9.2 vs 57.0±8.9, P=0.001), positive affect (46.6±8.9 vs 42.9±8.7, P=0.01), meaning and purpose (49.9±10.7 vs 46.2±10.5, P=0.03), global mental health (46.7±7.6 vs 43.1±9.2, P=0.01), and social isolation (52.2±7.5 vs 55.4±7.4, P=0.01). Multivariable analysis to account for the effects of other gender-affirming surgeries, hormone therapy duration, preexisting mental health diagnoses, socioeconomic disparities, and patient-reported quality of social relationships on psychosocial functioning demonstrated that completion of FFS was independently predictive of improved scores. Conclusions: Gender-affirming FFS improves the quality of life by multiple psychosocial domains in transfeminine patients.  © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, the role that romantic relationships can play in eating disorder (ED) recovery has not been comprehensively investigated. The present study aimed to explore the ways that people living with and recovering from EDs experience their romantic relationships, with the specific objective of developing a novel theoretical framework, grounded in the experiences of people in diverse romantic relationships, to guide future research on the topic. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with 66 people (45 cisgender women, 11 cisgender men, 9 nonbinary people, and 1 transgender man) living with and recovering from EDs while in romantic relationships. Our grounded theory analysis yielded a theoretical model of ED management in romantic relationships, revealing that Individual and Relationship Characteristics intersected with Relationship-Related Stressors and were navigated using Eating Disorder and Relationship Management Strategies. Combined with Partner Support and Tensions, these management strategies were related to Relationship and Mental Health Outcomes, which affected and were affected by Future Concerns. Future researchers should continue to build on, expand, and modify this model and further explore the role of romantic relationships in the experience of people living with EDs. © 2024 The Authors","Body image; Eating disorders; Recovery; Romantic partners; Romantic relationships","Adult; Body Image; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Grounded Theory; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Love; Male; Middle Aged; Qualitative Research; Sexual Partners; Transgender Persons; Young Adult; adult; body image; eating disorder; female; grounded theory; human; human relation; love; male; middle aged; psychology; qualitative research; sexuality; transgender; young adult","","","","","National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (5T34GM008303); National Institutes of Health, NIH","Funding text 1: The authors would like to the participants, who volunteered to share these intimate details of their lives with us.

Clinicians participated via professional networks and subsequent telephone contact. In addition to completing a survey, participants were invited to submit up to ten case studies. Results The survey response rate from in-patient units was 100% and 143 case studies were submitted. An estimated 622 patients received NGT feeding under restraint in England in 2020-2021. The most common diagnosis was anorexia nervosa (68.5-75.7%), with depression, anxiety and autism spectrum disorder the most frequent comorbidities. Patients receiving the intervention ranged from 11 to 60 years in age (mean 19.02 years). There was wide variation in duration of use, from once to daily for 312 weeks (mode 1 week; mean 29.1 weeks, s.d. = 50.8 weeks). Clinical implications NGT feeding under restraint is not uncommon in England, with variation in implementation. Further research is needed to understand how the high comorbidity and complexity contribute to initiation and termination of the intervention.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

This study aimed to explore the feasibility of recruiting teens with EDs to a digital intervention study via social media and a publicly available online ED screen, and to compare the characteristics of teens recruited by each approach in an exploratory fashion. Method: Teens aged 14–17 years old who screened positive for a clinical/subclinical ED or at risk for an ED and who were not currently in ED treatment completed a baseline survey to assess current ED symptoms, mental health comorbidities, and barriers to treatment. Bivariate analyses were conducted to examine differences between participants recruited via social media and those recruited after completion of a widely available online EDs screen (i.e., National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA] screen). Results: Recruitment of teens with EDs using the two online approaches was found to be feasible, with 934 screens completed and a total of 134 teens enrolled over 6 months: 77% (n = 103) via social media 23% (n = 31) via the NEDA screen. Mean age of participants (N = 134) was 16 years old, with 49% (n = 66) identifying as non-White, and 70% (n = 94) identifying as a gender and/or sexual minority. Teens from NEDA reported higher ED psychopathology scores (medium effect size) and more frequent self-induced vomiting and driven exercise (small effect sizes). Teens from NEDA also endorsed more barriers to treatment, including not feeling ready for treatment and not knowing where to find a counselor or other resources (small effect sizes). Discussion: Online recruitment approaches in this study reached a large number of teens with an interest in a digital intervention to support ED recovery, demonstrating the feasibility of these outreach methods. Both approaches reached teens with similar demographic characteristics; however, teens recruited from NEDA reported higher ED symptom severity and barriers to treatment. Findings suggest that proactive assessment and intervention methods should be developed and tailored to meet the needs of each of these groups. Public Significance: This study examined the feasibility of recruiting teens with EDs to a digital intervention research study via social media and NEDA's online screen, and demonstrated differences in ED symptoms among participants by recruitment approach. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","barriers to treatment; eating disorders; mHealth; screening; social media; teens","Adolescent; Comorbidity; Feasibility Studies; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Patient Selection; Social Media; Surveys and Questionnaires; adolescent; anxiety; Article; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; behavior; binge eating disorder; Caucasian; cognitive behavioral therapy; comorbidity; disease severity; distress syndrome; doctor patient relationship; eating disorder; Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire; effect size; emotionality; Epworth sleepiness scale; exercise; female to male transgender; generalized anxiety disorder; health care personnel; homosexual female; human; human experiment; Internet; interrater reliability; intervention study; lipogenesis; major depression; Melissa officinalis; mental disease; mental health; Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support; parental consent; Patient Health Questionnaire 8; personality; prevalence; psychological well-being; questionnaire; risk factor; semi structured interview; sexual and gender minority; sexual orientation; social media; social support; telehealth; visual field; comorbidity; eating disorder; feasibility study; female; male; mental health; patient selection; social media; therapy","","","","","","","Albano G., Lo Coco G., Teti A., Semola M., Valenti F., Pastizzaro C.D., Mignosi D., Gullo S., # How can we help you?: An Instagram-based online self-help for eating disorders, Sustainability, 15, 3, (2023); Ali K., Farrer L., Fassnacht D.B., Gulliver A., Bauer S., Griffiths K.M., Perceived barriers and facilitators towards help-seeking for eating disorders: A systematic review, International Journal of Eating Disorders, 50, 1, pp. 9-21, (2017); Ali K., Fassnacht D.B., Farrer L., Rieger E., Feldhege J., Moessner M., Griffiths K.M., Bauer S., What prevents young adults from seeking help?

While literature on EDs in TGE populations is growing and evolving, best practice guidelines are scant. A framework for providing gender-affirming care (GAC) in an ED treatment setting was developed by integrating findings from a focused literature review and insights from leading experts. Following synchronous and asynchronous training, the protocol was implemented in a virtual ED treatment setting with a national reach serving patients ages 6–24 years. This paper offers a summary of best practices and approaches for providing GAC in ED treatment settings. The use of GAC practices has the potential to address underlying issues and inequities in treatment delivery and outcomes. We encourage ED treatment providers to consider the adoption/adaptation of GAC best practices to more effectively meet the needs of TGE patients. More research is needed to better understand the influence of individual and collective GAC practices on specific ED treatment outcomes. © 2024 The Author(s).

Method: A total of 160 TGE adults (aged 18–30) were recruited across the United States. Participants completed a comprehensive online survey. Data were analyzed using generalized linear models and bivariate correlations. Results: Significant differences in appearance congruence among participants at different transition stages were revealed, with the group that achieved their desired transition reporting the highest appearance congruence compared to all other groups. Furthermore, gender-related motivations for weight loss were significantly lower in individuals who achieved their desired transition compared to those with no plans to transition. Discussion: Findings suggest significantly higher appearance congruence in those who achieved their desired transition compared to other groups, and individuals who attained their desired transition exhibited significantly reduced gender-related motivations for weight loss compared to those with no plans to transition. These findings underscore the potential psychological benefits associated with successful gender-affirming care, highlighting its role not only in fostering appearance congruence but also in mitigating gender-related motivations for weight loss among TGE individuals. Future research should include larger and more diverse samples, longitudinal designs, and considerations of other factors influencing body image outcomes in this population. Public Significance: This study sheds light on the crucial relationship between gender-affirming care and body image outcomes in TGE individuals. Understanding how appearance congruence and gender-related motivations for weight loss are associated with disordered eating can inform tailored support and interventions. By recognizing the association of gender affirming care and well-being, healthcare providers can enhance care for TGE individuals. © 2024 The Authors.

Mounting work suggests that gender minority stress (GMS) contributes to mental health outcomes in transgender/gender-nonconforming individuals. Aim: We assessed whether GMS decreased in transgender people after initiating gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT), and we identified social predictors and hormonal associations for GMS at 2 time points. Methods: GMS was surveyed through self-report questionnaires tapping into proximal and distal stressors and coping constructs following the minority stress framework. Eighty-five transgender persons wishing to undertake hormonal interventions were assessed prospectively at start of GAHT and after 7.7 ± 3.5 months (mean ± SD). Sixty-five cisgender persons served as a control group. Outcomes: (1) Proximal stressors were surveyed by the Beck Depression Inventory II, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Scale for Suicide Ideation, Suicidal Thoughts/Attempts, Stigma Consciousness Questionnaire, and Perceived Stress Scale; (2) distal stressors by the Everyday Discrimination Scale; and (3) coping constructs by the Resilience Scale, social network, social standing, and Marlowe Crowne Social Desirability Scale. Results: Transgender people experienced higher rates of proximal stressors (Beck Depression Inventory II, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Scale for Suicide Ideation, Suicidal Thoughts/Attempts, Perceived Stress Scale) and had lower protective factors (social standing) prior to and during GAHT than cisgender people. Social network and resilience were lower in transgender people relative to cisgender peers only at baseline. Prospectively, decreasing trait anxiety was observed in transgender people. Social factors were adequate predictors of multiple GMS constructs. Specifically, a major role for social network emerged. As for hormonal associations, only serum estradiol levels in transgender women with GAHT were negatively associated with trait anxiety and suicidal thoughts/attempts but positively with resilience and social desirability. Clinical Implications: Stimulating a social environment supportive of diverse identities, particularly by investing in social networks as a resource for resilience, is likely to alleviate GMS. Strengths and Limitations: Longer duration of interventions with sex steroid treatment, with continued resilience-enhancing strategies, is needed to observe further alleviation of GMS in transgender persons. Also, objective and subjective GMS identification with heteronormative attitudes and beliefs should be surveyed for good measure when assessing GMS. Conclusion: Transgender people experienced more GMS throughout study visits than cisgender people did. With a relatively short period of GAHT, some significant changes in and predictors for experienced GMS emerged. © The Author(s) 2023.

FD is related to mental illness, but the correlation is poorly defined in the pediatric population. Our study aims to investigate the risk of psychiatric disorders diagnosed after the FD diagnosis in children and adolescents. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study over a seven-year period (2016–2022) to measure the incidence and risk ratio of psychiatric disorders in patients under age 19 years. The FD cohort was defined as patients with FD (International Classification of Diseases, ICD-10-CM: L98.1); the control cohort was defined as patients who attended a regular dermatology visit by applying a diagnostic code of disease of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (ICD-10-CM: L00–99). Results: A total of 453 patients were identified for analysis. We found that FD patients were more likely to be diagnosed with anxiety disorder (Relative risk [RR] 7.63; P < 0.001), obsessive-compulsive disorder (RR 6.20; P < 0.001), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (RR 4.90, P < 0.001), depression (RR 2.27; p = 0.02), sleep disorder (RR 2.23; P = 0.01), impulse disorder (RR 2.20; P = 0.04), and conduct disorder (RR 2.14; P = 0.04) within 1 year following the diagnosis of FD. Conclusion: FD is highly comorbid with psychiatric disorders. Though some practitioners believe FD could result from experimental or recreational behavior in children and adolescents, possible underlying psychiatric disorders should never be overlooked. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Child and adolescent; Factitious dermatitis; Pediatric; Psychiatric disorder; Psychocutaneous disorder; Retrospective cohort study","Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Child; Comorbidity; Dermatitis; Humans; Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult; adjustment disorder; adolescent; anxiety disorder; Article; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; autism; child; cohort analysis; comorbidity; conduct disorder; controlled study; demographics; depression; dermatitis artefacta; disease association; eating disorder; female; gender dysphoria; health visitor; human; ICD-10-CM; impulse disorder; incidence; intellectual impairment; major clinical study; male; mental disease; obsessive compulsive disorder; posttraumatic stress disorder; prevalence; propensity score; retrospective study; risk; risk factor; school child; skin disease; sleep disorder; subcutaneous tissue; suicidal behavior; survival rate; Tic and Tourette disorder; adult; anxiety disorder; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; comorbidity; dermatitis; obsessive compulsive disorder; psychology; young adult","","","","","Carilion Health Analytics Research Team; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine at Carilion Clinic; Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine","We thank Dr. Robert L.

A variety of dietary interventions are used in practice, but little is known about their effectiveness. We compared clinical outcomes of patients (N = 100) undergoing eating disorder treatment, and user experience across two virtually delivered interventions: (1) Daily calorie target and (2) Plate-by-Plate™ approach. The calorie group gained more weight on average, though the difference was small (β = 1.62 [−0.02, 3.26]). Participants in both groups improve their eating disorder symptoms at roughly the same rate (β = 0.09 [−0.83, 1.04]). Caregivers in the Plate-by-Plate group increased confidence at a slower rate (β = 0.05 [−0.002, 0.09]). Caregivers rated the daily calorie target as more effective (β = 2.18 [0.94, 3.6]), and rated the two approaches equally for ease of use (β = -0.73 [−1.92, 0.48]). The daily calorie target approach was rated as more effective and was preferred overall by caregivers and dietitians. Findings challenge long-standing assumptions underlying FBT and suggest that clinicians should consider using a calorie framework with caregivers to guide renourishment efforts. © 2024 The Author(s).

By combining self-reported health data with clinical evaluations and incorporating demographic and clinical variables, the research offers a robust and previously unavailable health profile of this population. Methods: An anonymous online survey targeting TGD adults across Italy was conducted from June 2020 to June 2021. The survey consisted of self-reported health assessments and clinician-conducted evaluations, collecting data on chronic physical conditions, mental health disorders, infectious diseases, and gender-affirming care. Statistical analyses, including chi-square tests and logistic regression, identified associations between demographics and health outcomes. Results: Among 959 participants, mental health disorders were prevalent, with over half experiencing depression and/or anxiety. Non-binary individuals reported poorer health compared to binary individuals. Chronic conditions such as thyroid disorders were more common in individuals assigned female at birth (AFAB), whereas those assigned male at birth (AMAB) had higher rates of osteoporosis and sexually transmitted infections. Key health predictors included age, education, employment, and engagement in gender-affirming hormone therapy. Conclusion: The study reveals stark health disparities among TGD individuals in Italy, emphasizing the need for targeted health policies, expanded mental health services, and specialized healthcare provider training. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE) 2025.","Chronic disease; Gender identity; Healthcare disparities; Mental health; Non-binary; Transgender","Adolescent; Adult; Female; Gender-Affirming Care; Gender-Affirming Procedures; Health Status; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Italy; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Transgender Persons; Young Adult; atypical antipsychotic agent; benzodiazepine; mood stabilizer; serotonin agonist; serotonin noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor; serotonin uptake inhibitor; tricyclic antidepressant agent; adult; alcohol consumption; angina pectoris; anxiety disorder; Article; body mass; cerebrovascular accident; chronic bronchitis; chronic disease; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; diabetes mellitus; dyslipidemia; eating disorder; female; female to male transgender; gender affirming hormone therapy; gender diversity; gender identity; gender-affirming care; health service; heart infarction; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; hypertension; Likert scale; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; male to female transgender; meningioma; mental disease; osteoarthritis; osteoporosis; Parkinson disease; prevalence; psychosocial withdrawal; rheumatoid arthritis; smoking; syphilis; thyroid disease; adolescent; epidemiology; gender reassignment; gender-affirming care; health care disparity; health status; Italy; mental disease; middle aged; psychology; questionnaire; transgender; young adult","","benzodiazepine, 12794-10-4","STATA 18SE for Windows, StataCorp","StataCorp","Associazione Libellula Italia APS; Sat Pink APS; Osservatorio Nazionale sull’Identità di Genere; Associazione Consultorio Transgenere; Centro Salute Trans e Gender Variant; Center for Environmental Science and Technology, University of Notre Dame, CEST","The study was established with the co-funding of the European Union, National Operational Programme for social inclusion\u2013 European Social Fund 2014\u20132020.

Methods: Young adults in the 2022–2023 Healthy Minds Study (N = 24,431) completed the Brief Resilience Scale, Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II), and an ED screening tool. Results: Generalized linear models showed that lower resilience and psychological flexibility were associated with increased ED risk across gender and race-ethnicity categories. Asian American/Asians, American Indian/Alaskan Natives, cisgender women, and transgender women also showed elevated ED risk. An interaction between AAQ-II scores and gender identity revealed that transgender females demonstrated a stronger association between psychological inflexibility and ED risk compared to cisgender males. Resilience emerged as a protective factor regardless of racial-ethnic or gender identity. Discussion: Results highlight the importance of addressing resilience in future ED prevention and treatment and considering variability across racial-ethnic identity and gender in studies of ED risk. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Eating disorders; emotion regulation; gender identity; race; resilience","","","","","","University of Southern California, SC; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIAMDD, (K23DK128568); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIAMDD","This study was supported by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (K23DK128568).

Methods: Returning patients at a Midwestern gender clinic (n=164) ages 12-23 completed the NIAS, sick, control, one stone, fat, food (SCOFF), patient health questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), and generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD-7) during their clinic visit. Age, sex assigned at birth, gender identity, weight, and height were also collected. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to establish the hypothesized three-factor structure of the NIAS in this sample. Relationships between the NIAS subscales and anthropometric data, SCOFF, PHQ-9, GAD-7, and sex assigned at birth were explored for convergent and divergent validity, and proposed screening cutoff scores were used to identify the prevalence of likely avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) in this population. Results: The three-factor structure of the NIAS was an excellent fit to the current data. Approximately one in five (22%) of the participants screened positive for ARFID. Approximately one in four participants scored above the picky eating (27.4%) or appetite (23.9%) cutoffs. Assigned female at birth participants scored significantly higher on the NIAS-Total, Appetite, and Fear subscales than those assigned male at birth. NIAS-Total was significantly related to all convergent validity variables other than age, with a moderate-strong correlation with other symptom screeners (SCOFF, PHQ-9, GAD-7), and a small negative correlation with body mass index percentile. Conclusions: Evidence supports the NIAS as a valid measure to screen for ARFID among TGNB youth and young adults.

Data from 2762 Canadian adolescents and young adults from the Canadian Study of Adolescent Health Behaviors were analyzed. Frequencies were used to determine the prevalence of 11 different diets among the sample, and chi-square tests were used to assess gender differences. Multiple modified Poisson and linear regression analyses were conducted to determine the associations between any dieting and eating disorder attitudes and behaviors. Among the sample, 15.7 % of girls and women, 10.4 % of boys and men, and 13.0 % of transgender/gender expansive (TGE) participants reported any dieting in the past 12 months, with the Ketogenic diet being most common among all genders. Results from regression analyses showed that engaging in any dieting in the past 12 months was associated with greater eating disorder psychopathology among girls, women, boys, and men, but not TGE participants. There were varying trends in association between specific types of dieting practices and eating disorder behaviors among girls, women, boys, and men. Dieting is relatively common among a national sample of Canadian adolescents and young adults, and engagement is associated with greater eating disorder psychopathology and behaviors. Healthcare and public health professionals should consider screening for eating disorders among adolescents and young adults who report engaging in dieting practices. © 2024 The Author(s)","Adolescents; Dieting; Eating disorder behaviors; Ketogenic; Young adults","Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Canada; Diet, Reducing; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Feeding Behavior; Female; Health Behavior; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Young Adult; adolescent; adolescent health; adult; age distribution; Article; Atkins diet; Canada; chi square test; controlled study; data analysis; diet; diet therapy; disease association; eating disorder; feeding behavior; female; gluten free diet; health behavior; human; ketogenic diet; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; male; Mediterranean diet; Ornish diet; paleolithic diet; pathophysiology; Poisson regression; prevalence; raw food; regression analysis; sex difference; transgender; transgender and gender nonbinary; vegan diet; vegetarian diet; whole 30 diet; young adult; zone diet; adolescent behavior; attitude to health; Canada; eating disorder; epidemiology; feeding behavior; low calorie diet; psychology","","","","","University of Toronto, U of T; University of Toronto and Connaught Fund","This study was funded by the Connaught New Researcher Award (#512586) at the University of Toronto.

Qualitative data collected from 66 TGD young adults (18–30 years old; 29% self-identified as transgender women, 29% as transgender men, 39% as nonbinary people, and 3% as another gender identity (e.g., māhū)) in eight asynchronous online focus groups explored how socioeconomic determinants in conjunction with other dimensions of identity and lived experience shape disordered eating behavior (DEB) and ED risk. Participants described how economic barriers—including poverty and dependency on others (e.g. parents for health insurance)—and challenges produced by insurance and healthcare systems impeded healthcare access to the detriment of their overall mental health and risk for ED. In addition, participants shared different ways they leveraged financial resources to cope with stress, sometimes in ways that impelled disordered eating behaviors. Finally, participants described how poverty, socioeconomic advantage and disadvantage, and classism compound other systems of oppression (e.g. racism, ableism, weight bias) to adversely impact their general health and ED risk. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Adolescent; Adult; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Focus Groups; Humans; Male; Qualitative Research; Socioeconomic Factors; Transgender Persons; Young Adult; adult; Article; coping; eating disorder; exercise; feeding behavior; gender diverse; gender identity; gender reassignment; health care access; health care system; health insurance; human; human experiment; mental health; poverty; social determinants of health; social media; social status; socioeconomics; transgender; wheel exercise; young adult; adolescent; eating disorder; female; information processing; male; psychology; qualitative research; socioeconomics","","","","","Harvard Catalyst; Harvard University; National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS, (UL 1TR002541)","Funding text 1: This work was conducted with support from Harvard Catalyst | The Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Center (National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health Award UL 1TR002541) and financial contributions from Harvard University and its affiliated academic healthcare centers.

This paper describes the methods and study design from Project Gender NutriScope, a study that will explore the nutritional needs of TGD youth and young adults. Design: Parallel convergent cross-sectional mixed methods; community-engaged. Setting: A purposive sample will be recruited in a Midwest city through clinics, youth organizations, and a large state university. Participants: Transgender and gender-diverse youth and young adults aged 13–24 years. Intervention: Findings from this formative study will be used to inform future intervention development. Main Outcome Measures: Dietary intake, eating patterns, disordered eating patterns, food security status, perceptions of relationship with food, and nutrition-related concerns. Analysis: Quantitative data will be analyzed using descriptive summary statistics. Qualitative data will be analyzed by reflexive thematic analysis. The 2 databases will be integrated iteratively. © 2025 The Authors","community-engaged; exploratory methods; gender identity; nutrition assessment; transgender persons","Adolescent; Community-Based Participatory Research; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Research Design; Transgender Persons; Young Adult; adolescent; cross-sectional study; female; human; male; methodology; participatory research; transgender; young adult","","","","","National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS; Department of Human Sciences; Ohio State University, OSU, (UL1TR002733); Ohio State University, OSU","Funding text 1: This work was supported by The Ohio State University Department of Human Sciences, College of Nursing, and Award Number UL1TR002733 from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.

However, despite evidence of efficacy, apps have yet to be widely adopted and integrated into clinical practice. This study sought to understand mental health clinicians’ practices and perspectives of eating disorder apps. One-hundred-eighteen mental health clinicians (67 % Psychologists, 10 % Psychiatrists, 10 % Counsellors, 6 % Psychiatric Nurses; 7 % other) responded to a survey assessing current practices, knowledge, and attitudes related to apps in practice. Nearly two-thirds of clinicians (63 %) had used/discussed apps with clients; the most common reasons were that apps complement their services (80 % endorsed) and are efficient methods for monitoring symptoms and progress (89 % endorsed). The most common reason for clinicians who had not used/discussed apps with clients was not knowing which apps were appropriate to recommend (82 % endorsed). Nearly 50 % of clinicians reported little to no knowledge of current eating disorder apps, as well as limited confidence in using them effectively in practice. However, 8 in 10 clinicians were open to incorporating apps in treatment, and most agreed that apps can be beneficial for psychoeducation, skill utilization, relapse prevention, and offering support when access to other help options is limited. Overall, findings show that clinicians are enthusiastic about the potential of apps to assist in the management of eating disorders, but clear barriers to their adoption and integration in practice remain. We outline actionable strategies aimed at addressing these barriers and facilitating the broader integration of eating disorder apps into practice. © 2025","Apps; Digital health; Eating disorders; Mental health; Psychiatry","Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Mental Health Services; Middle Aged; Mobile Applications; Psychiatry; Smartphone; Surveys and Questionnaires; adult; Article; artificial intelligence; attitude; cell phone use; clinician; cognitive behavioral therapy; counselor; cross-sectional study; eating disorder; education; female; human; human experiment; knowledge; mental health; mental health care personnel; nurse; online questionnaire; psychiatrist; psychiatry; psychoeducation; psychologist; reading; social media; transgender; attitude to health; health care personnel; health personnel attitude; male; mental health service; middle aged; mobile application; questionnaire; smartphone; therapy","","","","","","","Baumeister H., Terhorst Y., Grassle C., Freudenstein M., Nubling R., Ebert D.D., Impact of an acceptance facilitating intervention on psychotherapists’ acceptance of blended therapy, PLoS One, 15, (2020); Fairburn C.G., Rothwell E.R., Apps and eating disorders: a systematic clinical appraisal, Int.

Method: This cross-sectional study utilized data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (N = 10,092, Mage = 12.9 years, 2019–2021). Gender diversity was measured using multiple dimensions, including categorical gender identity (e.g., transgender, cisgender), categorical and continuous felt gender (congruence between gender identity and assigned sex), ordinal gender non-contentedness (dissatisfaction with one's gender), and ordinal gender expression (communication of gender through appearance and mannerisms). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze the associations among gender diversity measures and eating disorder symptoms, adjusting for potential confounders. Results: Greater felt gender diversity was associated with self-worth tied to weight (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.11–1.53), binge eating (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.06–1.46), and distress with binge eating (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09–1.59). Greater gender expression diversity was associated with self-worth tied to weight (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02–1.33), distress with binge eating (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04–1.51), and characteristics of binge eating episodes (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.06–1.66). Gender non-contentedness was associated with self-worth tied to weight (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.20–1.58) and compensatory behaviors related to weight gain (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01–1.26). Transgender identity was not significantly associated with any eating disorder symptoms. Discussion: We found that greater gender diversity across multiple dimensions was associated with various eating disorder symptoms, and that measures beyond binary gender identity may be important to assess gender diversity in early adolescence. © 2024 The Author(s).

Little is known about such disparities in ED treatment samples, especially in outpatient treatment. We aimed to descriptively characterize and investigate baseline group differences in symptom severity between LGBTQ+ and CH ED outpatients at treatment intake. Data from 60 (22.3%) LGBTQ+ and 209 (77.7%) CH ED outpatients were used to examine: (1) demographic and diagnostic differences; (2) differences in ED, depressive, and emotion dysregulation symptoms. Objectives were tested using Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact and independent samples t-tests, and analyses of covariance adjusted for age and diagnosis, respectively. Most LGBTQ+ outpatients were bisexual (55.2%), and 6.5% identified as transgender and non-binary. LGBTQ+ outpatients presented to treatment at younger ages (Mean Difference [MD] = -3.39, p =.016) and reported more severe depressive symptoms (MD = 5.73, p =.004) than CH patients, but endorsed similar ED symptom and emotion dysregulation severity. Groups did not differ in other demographic or diagnostic characteristics. LGBTQ+ individuals may develop more severe depression and similarly severe EDs at earlier ages but seek outpatient care sooner than CH peers. Managing depressive symptoms may be particularly important for LGBTQ+ ED patients. © 2024 Taylor & Francis.","","Adolescent; Adult; Depression; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Heterosexuality; Humans;

However, Canadians experience food insecurity as well, which may have been heightened by the pandemic and its associated restrictions. The associations between food insecurity and ED psychopathology among Canadians remains underexamined. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore associations between food insecurity and ED psychopathology by gender identity among a national sample Canadian adolescents and young adults. Data were collected from 2714 participants aged 16 to 30 years old from across Canada. Participants reported sociodemographic characteristics, ED psychopathology, and food insecurity experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic through an online survey. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, ANOVAs, and regression analyses were conducted. Overall, 8.9% of the sample experienced food insecurity, with the highest prevalence among transgender and gender nonconforming individuals. Generally, those with no food insecurity reported the lowest ED psychopathology compared to higher ED psychopathology among those with food insecurity. Several unique differences were observed between cisgender men and cisgender women, while there were no significant associations between food insecurity and ED psychopathology found among transgender and gender nonconforming individuals. Further research is needed to investigate how the relationship between food insecurity and ED psychopathology differs based on gender, and to continue to explore food insecurity experienced beyond the COVID-19 pandemic as food insecurity possesses a considerable health threat to all. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Canada;

However, inattentive and impulsive tendencies and LOC often co-occur. Although LOC is an important diagnostic component of disordered eating (ED), it has recently been argued to be a dysregulated eating behavior in its own right. The purpose of the current self-report study was, therefore, to investigate the association between impulsive and inattentive tendencies and LOC in adults after accounting for ED. Method: A community sample of 516 adults was surveyed online about their inattentive and impulsive tendencies, LOC, and ED behaviors. Results: A hierarchical multiple linear regression revealed ED, inattentive, and impulsive symptoms to be independent, significant, positive predictors of LOC. Discussion: These findings suggest that the levels of inattentive and, to a lesser extent, impulsive tendencies are significantly associated with LOC in adults, even after ED is accounted for. Moreover, inattentive tendencies were found to be more significantly associated with LOC than impulsive tendencies. These are novel and important findings that can be used to inform both clinicians and individuals with inattentive and impulsive tendencies alike of this association. Considering the well-documented adverse health and wellbeing outcomes associated with LOC, future feasibility trials are needed aimed at treating this co-occurrence. © 2024 The Author(s).

There is a critical need to improve the understanding and prediction of suicide attempts in this vulnerable population. In this study, a primarily qualitative design was employed, supported by descriptive quantitative elements, such as code frequencies and word clouds, to explore in-depth narrative interviews of adolescents who attempted suicide. Thematic content analysis was utilized to analyze the transcripts of these narrative interviews. The study sample consisted of 22 adolescents (Mage = 16.98 years; SD = 1.624; 77% males, 19% females, 4% non-binary or transgender). The content analysis revealed two significant body-related risk factors for suicide attempts: experiences of violence or trauma and body dissatisfaction, which were associated with maladaptive coping strategies, including self-harm, substance use, and eating disorders. Acute somatic warning signs such as dissociative states, loss of control, and disconnection from one’s body suggested pronounced psychophysiological dysregulation. The findings underscore the body as a battleground, where emotional pain related to bodily experiences and perceptions manifests significantly. Future research should integrate subjective body-related experiences in risk assessments and interventions targeting adolescent suicidal behaviors. © 2025 by the authors.","acute risk; body dissatisfaction; body shaming; narrative interview; qualitative research; self-harm; suicide attempt; violence","Adolescent; Body Image; Female; Humans; Male; Qualitative Research; Risk Factors; Self-Injurious Behavior; Suicide, Attempted; Violence; body size; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; research work; risk factor; suicide; violence; young population; adolescent; Article; automutilation; body dissatisfaction; clinical article; content analysis; eating disorder; female; human; interview; male; psychological pain; qualitative research; risk assessment; substance use; suicidal behavior; suicide attempt; transgender; violence; vulnerable population; body image; psychology; qualitative research; risk factor","","","","","Gertrud Thalmann Fonds; H.

Frequently, teachers are used as interventionists to increase dissemination, decrease costs relative to researchers, and increase scalability. However, little is known about teacher concerns and barriers that may hinder successful uptake and implementation. The current study recruited a total of 269 teachers who consented to implement a universal body image and appearance-related bullying and teasing prevention program in their classrooms as part of a randomized controlled trial. Teachers expressed some worry that they may say the wrong thing, and concern about feeling uncomfortable teaching the program due to their own body dissatisfaction. Teacher’s ethnicity, gender, years teaching, dieting behaviors and other weight control behaviors, and self-efficacy were not associated with concerns related to teaching the curriculum. Teachers with lower body esteem reported higher concerns and anxiety related to teaching a body image curriculum. In free response items, teachers worried about handling student comments that were beyond the scope of the curriculum. Teacher self-efficacy was the only variable associated with the number of program sessions implemented. Findings suggest avenues to increase implementation. © 2024 by the authors.","behavioral interventions; body esteem; body image; eating pathology; implementation; mental health; prevention; self-efficacy; teacher; youth","Adult; Anxiety; Body Image; Bullying; Curriculum; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; School Teachers; Self Efficacy; curriculum; diet; disease control; implementation process; mental health; pathology; student; teaching; adult; aged; anxiety; Article; behavior; body dissatisfaction; body image; body weight control; bullying; content validity; curriculum; diet; Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire; eating disorder; ethnicity; female; General Self-Efficacy Scale; health behavior; health disparity; human; human experiment; interrater reliability; intervention study; job stress; knowledge; Likert scale; male; mental health; middle aged; perception; prophylaxis; questionnaire; self concept; self report; teacher; teaching; training; transgender; controlled study; eating disorder; prevention and control; psychology; randomized controlled trial; school teacher; self concept","","","SPSS version 28","","Unilever Corporation","This research was funded by the Dove Self Esteem Project, the philanthropic mission of Dove, Unilever Corporation.

Ambivalence about initiating treatment and/or recovery predicts treatment nonresponse for youth with other psychiatric disorders and may also contribute to poor FBT outcomes. Thus, understanding patient perspectives on FBT is essential to mitigating challenges to treatment acceptance, with great potential for improving treatment efficacy. Methods: A qualitative, inductive approach was used to develop hypotheses about adolescents' perspectives on FBT and patient-perceived facilitators of ED recovery. Semi-structured interview data were analyzed using a grounded theory methodology. Results: Interviewees (N = 10) expressed ambivalence toward FBT—particularly its use of parental empowerment and pragmatic focus on weight recovery. Many participants stated that FBT was effective, necessary for recovery, and improved relationships with caregivers; however, some reported that a perceived lack of agency and sidelining of psychosocial distress and family conflict negatively impacted their treatment engagement. Regarding ED recovery, participants reported a preference for cognitive/emotional aspects of recovery and framed recovery as an ongoing or lifelong process. Peer support was identified as an important facilitator of behavior change. Discussion: Findings support addressing adolescent concerns (e.g., psychosocial well-being, agency, connection with peers, and family relationships) within the FBT framework. Results may inform future FBT implementation and adaptation and suggest the need for continued investigation of the treatment experience from multiple perspectives (i.e., patients, family members, and clinicians). © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","adolescent; eating disorders; family-based treatment; grounded theory; qualitative","Adolescent; Family Therapy; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Humans; Male; Pilot Projects; Qualitative Research; adolescent; adult; anorexia; anxiety; Article; behavior change; body image; body weight; caregiver; clinical article; clinician; cognition; demographics; depression; eating disorder; empowerment; family; family therapy; female; gender dysphoria; human; interview; male; physiological stress; pilot study; pragmatism; social well-being; transgender; transgender and gender nonbinary; eating disorder; procedures; psychology; qualitative research; therapy","","","NVivo software","","University of California, San Francisco, UCSF; National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (K23MH126201, R21MH131787); National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH; Brain and Behavior Research Foundation, BBRF, (T32MH018261); Brain and Behavior Research Foundation, BBRF","Funding text 1: Funding: This work was supported by the UCSF Inquiry Funding Office Summer Explore Research Fellowship.

This study aimed to assess the relationship between DSM-5 Alternative Model of Personality Disorder (AMPD) maladaptive personality facets and self-report dissociation in a sample of patients with BPD. Methods: Our sample consisted of 178 Italian adult patients who met the criteria for BPD diagnosed by Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV-Axis II. They were administered the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5) and the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES). An agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using facets as clustering variables. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify the PID-5 characteristics which could suggest a dissociative dimension. Results: Our results showed the potential of PID-5 to hypothesize a dissociative dimension towards DES scores. Therefore, we theorized a specific BPD phenotype characterized by high levels of Unusual Behaviors and Beliefs, high levels of Perceptual Dysregulation, high levels of Withdrawal, low levels of Impulsivity and Irritability, low levels of Callousness and low levels of Avoidance, for which it may be assumed a dissociative framework. Moreover, it could be postulated that patients with dissociative symptoms who will be diagnosed with BPD according to the AMDP would have the domain of Psychoticism as “specifier”. Lastly, we highlighted the role of gender as a moderator between personality traits and dissociative symptoms. Conclusion: Consistently with this study, an initial assessment with PID-5 personality facets may detect an underlying dissociative psychopathology, suggesting significant clinical implications for both treatment and prognosis. © 2024 The Author(s)","Alternative model of personality disorder;

Research suggests that LBW are vulnerable to both traditional risk factors for binge eating found in general samples of women (e.g., emotion dysregulation) and risk factors specific to their sexual minority identity (e.g., experiences of heterosexist discrimination). This study tested a within-person model of binge eating in a sample of 233 young adult cisgender LBW. The model was based on the psychological mediation framework. Participants completed online surveys assessing binge eating, internalized stigma, depressive symptoms, and experiences with heterosexist discrimination every evening for a period of 9 days. Data were analyzed using dynamic structural equation modeling. Approximately 22.3% of participants reported at least one binge eating episode during the study period. Results provided partial support for the psychological mediation framework. Same-day discrimination, but not previous-day discrimination, indirectly predicted binge eating through the mediator of depressive symptoms. Internalized stigma was unrelated to binge eating. Body appreciation moderated the within-person association between depressive symptoms and binge eating, such that women with higher levels of body appreciation exhibited a weaker association between these variables. Sexual orientation and sense of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer community membership did not moderate the associations between discrimination, internalized stigma, or depressive symptoms and binge eating. Results reveal the importance of investigating the complex relations between general psychological and sexual minority-specific risk factors when attempting to understand elevated rates of psychopathology among sexual minority populations. Little research has examined the predictors of binge eating among lesbian and bisexual women. The present study demonstrates that depressive symptoms and experiences of heterosexist discrimination are associated with binge eating in this population. © 2025 American Psychological Association","binge eating; bisexual; discrimination; lesbian","","","","","","","","Allison S., Timmerman G.

We reviewed the literature regarding the relationship between ovulatory menstrual cycles (MCs) and BC risk. Physiological variations in the frequency of MCs and interference with MCs through genetic variations, pathological conditions and or pharmaceutical interventions revealed a strong link between BC risk and the lifetime number of MCs. A substantial reduction in BC risk is observed in situations without MCs. In genetic or transgender situations with normal female breasts and estrogens, but no progesterone (P4), the incidence of BC is very low, suggesting an essential role of P4. During the MC, P4 has a strong proliferative effect on normal breast epithelium, whereas estradiol (E2) has only a minimal effect. The origin of BC has been strongly linked to proliferation associated DNA replication errors, and the repeated stimulation of the breast epithelium by P4 with each MC is likely to impact the epithelial mutational burden. Long-lived cells, such as stem cells, present in the breast epithelium, can carry mutations forward for an extended period of time, and studies show that breast tumors tend to take decades to develop before detection. We therefore postulate that P4 is an important factor in a woman’s lifetime risk of developing BC, and that breast tumors arising during hormonal contraception or after menopause, with or without menopausal hormone therapy, are the consequence of the outgrowth of pre-existing neoplastic lesions, eventually stimulated by estrogens and some progestins. © 2023, The Author(s).","Breast cancer; DNA replication; Estrogens; Menstrual cycles; Progesterone; Tumor doubling time; WNT4","Breast Neoplasms; Estradiol; Estrogens; Female; Humans; Menstrual Cycle; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Progesterone; estrogen; progesterone; drug; estradiol; estrogen; progesterone; amenorrhea; anorexia nervosa; Article; body weight loss; breast cancer; cancer risk; clinical feature; female; human; hypogonadotropic hypogonadism; lactation; menarche; menopause; menstrual cycle; ovariectomy; ovary polycystic disease; pregnancy outcome; premature ovarian failure; risk factor; breast tumor; genetics; menstrual cycle; physiology","","progesterone, 57-83-0; estradiol, 50-28-2; Estradiol, ; Estrogens, ; Pharmaceutical Preparations, ; Progesterone, ","","","Astrid van den Heuvel; Cathrin Brisken; SREC; Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research","The authors thank Cathrin Brisken (SREC—Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Lausanne, Switzerland) for her critical review of a draft version of the present manuscript.

Yet, the prevalence of EDs among queer and trans (QnT) individuals, coupled with the lack of interventions that attend to contextual factors related to sexual orientation and gender identity, underscore a critical health disparity issue requiring urgent attention. Here, we first review factors pertaining to QnT individuals’ minoritized sexual and gender identities that are important to consider in ED conceptualization for this population (e.g., minority stressors, identity-based body image standards). Next, we describe problematic assumptions present in existing ED assessment and propose more inclusive approaches. Lastly, we provide suggestions for practices that providers can implement within their treatment of EDs among QnT individuals. © 2024 The Menninger Foundation.","eating disorders; evidence-based treatment; gender identity; LGBTQ; sexual orientation","Body Image; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Gender Identity; Humans; Male; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Transgender Persons; anorexia nervosa; Article; body image; bulimia; clinical practice; cognitive behavioral therapy; disease assessment; eating disorder; evidence based practice; gender identity; health care delivery; health care personnel; health care planning; health disparity; human; LGBTQIA+ people; minority group; population structure; risk factor; sexual orientation; eating disorder; female; male; psychology; sexual and gender minority; therapy; transgender","","","","","National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, NIMHD; National Institutes of Health, NIH","Melissa Simone is supported by the Transition to Independence Award (K99MD015770) from the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities.

This exploratory study examined whether disordered eating behaviors moderate the observed relationship between gender and suicide among adolescents. Multivariate logistic regression was performed on the population-based 2023 Healthy Kids Colorado Survey (HKCS) data (N = 49,989) to test whether the odds of suicide ideation and attempt differed by gender groups, and modeling was carried out to examine the moderation of these relationships by disordered eating behaviors. Additionally, analyses were replicated among only gender minority groups (n = 2486). Compared to cismale students, the prevalence of disordered eating was higher among all other gender identities. There was a significantly higher risk of suicidal ideation and attempts among transfemale, transmale, nonbinary and gender-questioning students. Disordered eating did not significantly moderate the relationship between gender and suicide outcomes. These findings underscore the heightened vulnerability of TGD youth to disordered eating and suicidal behaviors while suggesting that disordered eating may not be a pathway through which gender relates to suicide outcomes. © 2025 by the authors.","adolescent mental health; disordered eating; gender dysphoria; gender identity; health psychology; suicide; transgender","Adolescent; Colorado; Cross-Sectional Studies; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Humans; Male; Prevalence; Sex Factors; Students; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide; Colorado; United States; food consumption; gender identity; gender relations; gender role; mental health; psychology; suicide; young population; adolescent; Article; Colorado; cross-sectional study; eating disorder; education; ethnicity; gender diversity; gender dysphoria; gender identity; gender-affirming care; health survey; high school student; human; LGBT people; prevalence; race; sexual and gender minority; sociodemographics; suicidal behavior; suicidal ideation; suicide; suicide attempt; transgender; epidemiology; female; male; psychology; sex factor; student; suicide","","","SAS 9.4, SAS, United States","SAS, United States","Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, CDPHE","This study received no external funding.

However, gaps remain in the knowledge base on whether social media use and engaging with fitness- and weight-related online content are associated with the use of legal appearance- and performance-enhancing drugs and substances (APEDS; e.g., whey protein), which was the aim of this study. Data from participants ages 16–30 years in Canadian Study of Adolescent Health Behaviors (N = 2731) were analyzed. Multiple modified Poisson regression analyses were conducted to determine the associations between hours per day of social media use and any engagement with fitness- and weight-related online content in the past 30 days and use of 10 different legal APEDS in the past 30 days. Greater time on social media was significantly associated with use of energy drinks and pre-workout drinks or powders in the past 30 days. Engaging with fitness- and weight-related online content was significantly associated with the use of caffeine, creatine monohydrate, pre-workout drinks or powders, probiotics, protein bars, and whey protein powders or shakes in the past 30 days. These findings expand prior research on the correlates of social media use and engagement with fitness- and weight-related online content among young people and have important implications for healthcare and public health professionals, as well as technology companies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Canada; Creatine; Social media use; Whey protein","Adolescent; Body Image; Canada; Humans; Performance-Enhancing Substances; Powders; Social Media; Whey Proteins; amino acid; branched chain amino acid; caffeine; creatine; diuretic agent; performance enhancing substance; probiotic agent; whey protein; adolescent behavior; adult; Article; bisexuality; Black person; body dissatisfaction; Caucasian; East Asian; eating disorder; energy drink; female; fitness; health behavior; health care personnel; heterosexuality; Hispanic; human; knowledge gap; LGBTQIA+ people; major clinical study; male; maximum likelihood method; Middle Eastern (person); Poisson regression; public health; social media; sociodemographics; South Asian; transgender; weight; young adult; adolescent; body image; Canada; powder","","amino acid, 65072-01-7; caffeine, 58-08-2; creatine, 57-00-1; Performance-Enhancing Substances, ; Powders, ; Whey Proteins, ","","","University of Toronto, U of T","This study was funded by the Connaught New Researcher Award (# 512586 ) at the University of Toronto.

The sample included 3299 adults who screened positive for ARFID using two validated scales. SI over the past two weeks was assessed using item 9 from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The overall prevalence of SI was 22.9 %, with a higher prevalence among transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) individuals (34.7 %) compared to cisgender men (17.8 %) and cisgender women (16.8 %). Participants with SI (mean = 27.6 years, SD = 10.1) were younger than those without SI (mean = 32.3 years, SD = 13.4). The ARFID dimensions picky eating/sensory-based avoidance and low appetite/lack of interest in eating or food were positively associated with SI; however, these associations became non-significant after adjusting for age, gender, and depression. Interestingly, fear/concern about aversive consequences was significantly negatively associated with SI after adjusting for covariates. Our results suggest that the fear presentation of ARFID may be a distinct subtype with a lower risk of suicidality compared to other presentations, highlighting the importance of comprehensively evaluating ARFID dimensions and underlying depressive symptoms to better address the risk of suicidality. © 2025","Eating disorders; Picky eating; Selective eating; Suicidality; Suicide","Adolescent; Adult; Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Suicidal Ideation; Transgender Persons; Young Adult; adult; appetite; Article; avoidant restrictive food intake disorder; depression; eating disorder; Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire; false discovery rate; female; food fussiness; human; human experiment; male; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; prevalence; questionnaire; social media; sociodemographics; suicidal ideation; transgender; adolescent; eating disorder; epidemiology; middle aged; psychology; young adult","","","SAS 9.4, SAS","SAS","University of North Carolina Suicide Prevention Institute; ARFID; Svenska Sällskapet för Medicinsk Forskning, SSMF, (PG-22-0478); Svenska Sällskapet för Medicinsk Forskning, SSMF; ARFID Genes and Environment study, (R56MH129437)","Funding text 1: Data for this study was from the ARFID Genes and Environment study (ARFID-GEN) R56MH129437 (Bulik/Micali mPIs).

The prevalence of eating disorders among transgender and nonbinary (TGNB) adolescents and young adults (AYA) ranges from 5% to 18% and studies have found a higher risk of disordered eating among these AYA in comparison to their cisgender peers. However, there is minimal research on why TGNB AYA are at higher risk. The aim of this study is to understand unique factors that define a TGNB AYA's relationship between their body and food, how this relationship may be affected by gender-affirming medical care, and how these relationships may contribute to disordered eating. Methods: A total of 23 TGNB AYA were recruited from a multidisciplinary gender-affirming clinic to participate in semistructured interviews. Transcripts were analyzed using Braun and Clarke's theory of thematic analysis (2006). Results: The average age of participants was 16.9 years. Forty-four percent of participants identified as having a transfeminine gender identity, 39% transmasculine, and 17% nonbinary/gender fluid. Five themes emerged regarding TGNB participants' relationship to food and exercise: gender dysphoria and control over one's body, societal expectations of gender, mental health and safety concerns, emotional and physical changes with gender-affirming medical care, and recommended resources for TGNB AYA. Conclusion: By understanding these unique factors, clinicians can provide targeted and sensitive care when screening and managing disordered eating among TGNB AYA.

Minoritised adolescents might be at higher risk of disordered eating due to minority stress, but most research has focused on White, heterosexual, cisgender individuals; less is known about disordered eating among minoritised adolescents. We examined sexual, gender, racial, and ethnic identities in relation to disordered eating in early adolescence. Method: Using 2-year follow-up data from adolescents ages 10–14 in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (N = 9385), we examined associations between sexual, gender, racial, and ethnic identities and past-2 week disordered eating (preoccupation with weight, weight control behaviors, and binge eating). Results: Compared to heterosexual peers, gay/bisexual adolescents had higher odds of all three outcomes (AOR 1.90–3.32); those “questioning” their sexual identity had higher odds of preoccupation with weight (AOR 1.82) and binge eating (AOR 2.53). Compared to cisgender adolescents, transgender adolescents had higher odds of binge eating (AOR 2.62); those “questioning” their gender identity had higher odds of preoccupation with weight (AOR 2.45). Adolescents whose racial identity was categorised as “Another” had higher odds of preoccupation with weight (AOR 1.46) and weight control behaviors (AOR 1.58) compared to White adolescents. Finally, Hispanic adolescents had higher odds of all disordered eating outcomes than non-Hispanic adolescents (AOR 1.25–1.59). Discussion: This study is among the first to reveal disparities in disordered eating among minoritised early adolescents. Further examination of these disparities can inform future interventions. Healthcare providers are encouraged to screen for disordered eating, recognising that minoritised early adolescents may be at risk. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","disordered eating; ethnic minority; gender minority; health disparities; racial minority; sexual minority","Adolescent; Child; Ethnicity; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Male; adolescent; child; eating disorder; epidemiology; ethnicity; female; health disparity; human; male; psychology","","","","","National Institute of Nursing Research; National Institute of Nursing Research, NINR; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (U01DA041156, U01DA041120, U01DA051037, U01DA051039, U01DA050987, U01DA051016, U01DA041022, U01DA050988, U01DA041106, U01DA041028, U01DA041134, U01DA041148, U01DA041048, U01DA041093, U01DA041025, U01DA050989, U01DA041117, U24DA041123, U01DA051018, U01DA041089, U01DA051038, U01DA041174, U24DA041147); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institutes of Health, (U01DA041134, U01DA041048, F31NR020733‐01, U01DA041028, U01DA041025, U01DA041106, U01DA041093, U01DA051016, U01DA041156, U01DA051039, U24DA041147, U01DA041120, U01DA050987, U01DA041022, U01DA051038, U01DA041148, U01DA051037, U01DA050988, U01DA041089, U01DA041174, U01DA050989, U01DA041117, U01DA051018, U24DA041123); Clinical Center, CC, (F31NR020733-01); Clinical Center, CC","Funding text 1: Dr. Sarah I.

Despite these advances, transgender and gender-diverse individuals continue to face significant mental health challenges, including elevated rates of anxiety, depression as well as high prevalence of autistic traits. Gender-affirming hormonal treatment (GAHT) has been suggested to improve mental health and quality of life (QoL) among transgender individuals; however, the short- and long-term treatment effects of GAHT are not yet fully understood. Therefore, this study aims to establish a comprehensive cohort of transgender individuals at the Centre for Gender Identity (CGI), Aalborg University Hospital, Denmark, to enhance understanding and treatment outcomes. Methods and analysis The Transgender Cohort (TraCK) will recruit participants from February 14, 2024, with recruitment occurring continuously alongside yearly follow-up. This single-centre cohort study will include both retrospective and prospective data collection. Transgender individuals referred to CGI will be invited to participate in the study via the Danish digital mail system called e-Boks. Participants must provide informed consent and complete a baseline questionnaire. Data will be collected from self-reported questionnaires and medical records across multiple specialists. Self-reported questionnaires include WHO-Quality of Life BREF, Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire, Autism Spectrum Quotient, Transgender Congruence Scale, and Gender Minority Stress and Resilience Measure. Medical records will provide information on demographics, mental health, physical health, and gender-affirming treatment details. Data will be managed using REDCap, ensuring compliance with GDPR and the National Data Protection Act. Ethics and dissemination While recognising the potential privacy risks associated with data collection, the study considers these outweighed by the benefits of advancing knowledge on gender diversity and the impacts of gender-affirming care. The North Jutland Region Ethics Committee reviewed the project, determining no formal approval was needed, but it was registered and approved (no. F2024-012) by the North Jutland Region. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, conferences, and accessible reports for participants. Registration details This study is registered with the North Jutland Region (no. F2024-012). Recruitment and data collection began on February 14, 2024, and will continue alongside yearly follow-up.

However, evidence indicates potential problems with its original factor structure and associated psychometric properties in a variety of populations, including gender minority populations. The aim of the current investigation was to explore several previously published EDE-Q factor structures and to examine internal consistency and measurement invariance of the best-fitting EDE-Q model in a large community sample of gender minority adults. Methods: Data were drawn from 1567 adults (337 transgender men, 180 transgender women, and 1050 gender-expansive individuals) who participated in The PRIDE Study, a large-scale longitudinal cohort study of sexual and gender minorities from the United States. A series of confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were conducted to explore the fit of eight proposed EDE-Q models; internal consistency (Cronbach's alphas, Omega coefficients) and measurement invariance (multi-group CFA) were subsequently evaluated. Results: A brief seven-item, three-factor (dietary restraint, shape/weight overvaluation, body dissatisfaction) model of the EDE-Q consistently evidenced the best fit across gender minority groups (transgender men, transgender women, gender-expansive individuals). The internal consistencies of the three subscales were adequate in all groups, and measurement invariance across the groups was supported. Discussion: Taken together, these findings support the use of the seven-item, three-factor version of the EDE-Q for assessing eating disorder symptomatology in gender minority populations. Future studies can confirm the current findings in focused examinations of the seven-item, three-factor EDE-Q in diverse gender minority samples across race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and age ranges. Public Significance Statement: Although transgender individuals have greater risk of developing an eating disorder, the factor structure of the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire, one of the most widely used eating disorder assessment measures, has not been explored in transgender adults. We found that a seven-item model including three factors of dietary restraint, shape and weight overvaluation, and body dissatisfaction had the best fit among transgender and nonbinary adults. © 2023 The Authors.

Although extant literature has established that self-compassion protects against EDs among the cisgender population, research among TNB adults is nascent. The current study sought to identify whether internalized transnegativity and components of self-compassion (i.e., self-warmth and self-coldness) were independently associated with ED symptomatology, and whether the components of self-compassion moderated the relation between internalized transnegativity and ED symptomatology. An international sample of 127 TNB adults aged between 18 and 69 years (M = 32.24, SD = 11.12) completed the Transgender Identity Survey, the Self-Compassion Scale, and the Screen for Disordered Eating via an online survey. Simple linear regression models were run, followed by moderation analyses. Internalized transnegativity and self-coldness were associated with ED symptomatology, but self-warmth was not. Self-warmth and self-coldness did not moderate the relation between internalized transnegativity and ED symptomatology. The results highlight that self-coldness and, to a lesser extent, internalized transnegativity account for a significant portion of the variance in ED symptomatology among TNB adults. Although these effect sizes were small, they have important clinical implications. Future research should take alternative analytical approaches to examine how self-warmth, self-coldness, and internalized transnegativity are related to ED symptomatology among TNB adults. © 2025 The Author(s).

However, the role of specific NSSI functions and the role of emotional valence in alexithymia, remain unclear. Thus, the present study investigated associations between lifetime-NSSI, alexithymia, and emotion regulation strategies (expressive suppression, cognitive reappraisal), focusing on NSSI functions and emotional valence in alexithymia. Methods: A total of 328 participants (M = 29.18 years, SD = 12.73) with and without lifetime-NSSI participated in the study. They completed online questionnaires regarding alexithymia, NSSI, and preferred emotion regulation strategies. A binominal logistic regression was computed to predict NSSI group assignment. Results: Participants with lifetime-NSSI reported significantly higher levels of alexithymia, more frequent use of expressive suppression, and less frequent use of cognitive reappraisal than those without NSSI. Alexithymia correlated with a higher tendency for expressive suppression and reduced cognitive reappraisal. Both positive and negative emotional alexithymia were linked to NSSI, with alexithymia significantly associated with stronger endorsement of intrapersonal-positive NSSI functions. Key predictors of NSSI group membership included younger age, lower use of cognitive reappraisal, and greater difficulty in appraising feelings. Limitations: The cross-sectional design precluded causal inferences. Conclusions: Findings reveal that individuals with lifetime-NSSI exhibit higher levels of alexithymia, favor expressive suppression as maladaptive emotion regulation strategy, and exhibit greater difficulty in adaptive cognitive reappraisal compared to those without NSSI. These findings underscore the importance to address emotion regulation and alexithymia in NSSI interventions. This is the first study to report a link between alexithymia and the endorsement of specific (intrapersonal-positive) NSSI functions. © 2025 The Author(s)","Alexithymia; Cognitive reappraisal; Emotion regulation; Expressive suppression; Non-suicidal self-injury","Adolescent; Adult; Affective Symptoms; Emotional Regulation; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Self-Injurious Behavior; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; aged; alexithymia; antisocial behavior; anxiety disorder; Article; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; autism; automutilation; bipolar disorder; cognitive reappraisal; compulsion; consultation; cross-sectional study; demographics; depression; discriminant validity; distress syndrome; eating disorder; emotion regulation; emotion regulation questionnaire; female; gender dysphoria; groups by age; human; injury; Kolmogorov Smirnov test; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; mental hospital; middle aged; online questionnaire; patient counseling; personality disorder; Perth Alexithymia questionnaire; psychosis; self-injurious thoughts and behaviors interview; somatoform disorder; substance use; telehealth; Toronto Alexithymia scale; valence (emotion); young adult; emotion; emotional disorder; psychology; questionnaire","","","","","","","Abler B., Kessler H., ERQ - Emotion Regulation Questionnaire: Verfahrensdokumentation aus PSYNDEX Tests-Nr. 9006192 und Fragebogen, (2011); American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostisches und Statistisches Manual Psychischer Störungen DSM-5: Deutsche Ausgabe herausgegeben von Peter Falkai und Hans-Ulrich Wittchen, mitherausgegeben von Manfred Döpfner, Wolfgang Gaebel, Wolfgang Maier, Winfried Rief, (2018); Angelakis I., Gooding P., Experiential avoidance in non-suicidal self-injury and suicide experiences: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Suicide Life Threat Behav, 51, 5, pp. 978-992, (2021); Bagby R.M., Taylor G.J., Parker J.D.A., The twenty-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale: II.

Methods: A cross-sectional electronic survey was distributed to the global network of endocrine societies. Respondents’ professional and practice profiles, clinic sizes, their country of practice, and the impact of COVID-19 on endocrine diseases were investigated. Results: Respondents from 131 pediatric endocrine centers in 51 countries across all continents completed the survey. Routine check-ups and education were altered in most pediatric endocrine clinics. Over 20% of clinics experienced a shortage of critical medications or essential supplies. ICU treatment was required for patients with diabetes and COVID-19 in 21.2% of centers. In diabetes, 44% of respondents reported increased diabetic ketoacidosis episodes in newly diagnosed cases and 30% in established cases. Biopsychosocial and behavioral changes were explicitly reported to be occurring among pediatric patients with endocrine disorders. Conclusions: This large global survey conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic highlights that diabetes is more challenging to manage than any other pediatric endocrine disorder, with an increased risk of morbidity. Psychological distress due to COVID-19 needs to be recognized and addressed. The importance of close contact with healthcare professionals should be emphasized, and medical supplies should be readily available to all patients. © Copyright © 2021 Elbarbary, dos Santos, de Beaufort, Wiltshire, Pulungan and Scaramuzza.","adrenal; children; COVID-19; diabetes; growth; obesity and metabolic syndrome; puberty; thyroid","anemia; anxiety; Article; behavior change; bone metabolism; child; clinical practice; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; depression; diabetes mellitus; diabetic ketoacidosis; eating disorder; education; endocrine disease; female; gender dysphoria; genetic screening; glucose blood level; glycemic control; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; insulin treatment; major clinical study; male; mental stress; metabolic syndrome X; morbidity; pandemic; pediatric patient; pharmacist; physical activity; preschool child; questionnaire; school child; suicide attempt; teleconsultation; thyroid disease","","","","","International Consortium for Pediatric Endocrinology","The authors would like to express their gratitude to all survey respondents who shared their expertise and experience by participating in the survey and making this study possible.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between gender identity, gender affirming interventions such as gender affirming hormones (GAH) and gender affirming surgeries (GAS), and ED symptomatology. Method: Transgender patients at a primary care outpatient gender health program in the United States completed a survey consisting of demographics, medical history, and clinical variables, including the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q). Multivariate analyses of covariance were conducted to compare EDE-Q scores across gender identity and gender affirmation. Results: Compared to transgender men (n = 79), transgender women (n = 87) reported higher EDE-Q scores and significantly higher Eating Concern. Compared to hormone/surgery-naïve and hormone-experienced/surgery-naïve patients, hormone/surgery-experienced patients had lower EDE-Q scores. Hormone/surgery-experienced patients reported significantly lower Shape Concern and marginally lower Global Score and Weight Concern than hormone-experienced/surgery-naïve patients. There were no differences in EDE-Q scores between hormone/surgery-naïve and hormone-experienced/surgery-naïve patients. Discussion: Transgender patients report high levels of ED symptomatology. There are subtle, yet important, differences in ED between gender identities and gender affirmations. High ED prevalence may result from the dual pathways of sociocultural pressures as well as gender dysphoria. Both GAH and GAS may be effective interventions to support gender affirmation and thereby alleviate ED symptomatology. While the potential positive benefits of GAS on ED are more apparent, the effects of GAH are less clear. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","disordered eating; eating disorders; gender affirmation; gender minority persons; hormones; patients; surgeries; transgender persons","Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Gender Identity; Hormones; Humans; Male; Surveys and Questionnaires; Transgender Persons; United States; hormone; adult; Article; clinical feature; demography; eating disorder; female; female to male transgender; gender affirming hormone therapy; gender affirming surgery; gender identity; hormonal therapy; human; major clinical study; male; male to female transgender; medical history; plastic surgery; sex difference; symptomatology; transgender; eating disorder; gender identity; questionnaire; United States","","Hormones, ","","","","","Ainsworth T.A., Spiegel J.H., Quality of life of individuals with and without facial feminization surgery or gender reassignment surgery, Quality of Life Research, 19, 7, pp. 1019-1024, (2010); Algars M., Alanko K., Santtila P., Sandnabba N.K., Disordered eating and gender identity disorder: A qualitative study, Eating Disorders, 20, 4, pp. 300-311, (2012); Avila J.T., Golden N.H., Aye T., Eating disorder screening in transgender youth, Journal of Adolescent Health, 65, 6, pp. 815-817, (2019); Azeem R., Zubair U.B., Jalil A., Kamal A., Nizami A., Minhas F., Prevalence of suicide ideation and its relationship with depression among transgender population, Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan, 29, 4, pp. 349-352, (2019); Branstrom R., Pachankis J.E., Reduction in mental health treatment utilization among transgender individuals after gender-affirming surgeries: A total population study, American Journal of Psychiatry, 177, 8, pp. 727-734, (2020); Diemer E.W., White Hughto J.M., Gordon A.R., Guss C., Austin S.B., Reisner S.L., Beyond the binary: Differences in eating disorder prevalence by gender identity in a transgender sample, Transgender Health, 3, 1, pp. 17-23, (2018); Ewan L.A., Middleman A.B., Feldmann J., Treatment of anorexia nervosa in the context of transsexuality: A case report, International Journal of Eating Disorders, 47, 1, pp. 112-115, (2014); Fairburn C.G., Beglin S.J., Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q).

This study examined how identity development and minority stress relate to the presence of disordered eating behaviors and cognitions in transgender and gender nonbinary individuals, and improvement at one-year follow-up. Methods: Data come from a multi-site, longitudinal study of transgender and gender nonbinary individuals (n = 287) and includes assessment of transgender congruence, receipt of gender-affirming care, minority stress, and disordered eating symptoms. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was used to test for associations between identity development, minority stress, and eating-related psychopathology. Results: Eighty-three participants (28.9%) met criteria for current eating-related psychopathology. Loss of control eating was the most commonly endorsed behavior, followed by laxative, diuretic, or other medication use, and compulsive exercise. Higher transgender congruence was associated with lower odds of disordered eating symptoms (OR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.55–0.94), whereas increased internalized transphobia was associated with greater odds of disordered eating symptoms (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.04–1.91). Participants with eating-related psychopathology had greater odds of having received gender-affirming psychotherapy in the year prior to assessment (OR = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.32–4.14). Conclusions: Results suggest that gender identity development and internalized transphobia are associated with eating-related psychopathology in transgender and gender nonbinary individuals. Mental health providers should consider assessing all transgender and gender nonbinary individuals for eating-related psychopathology and unique risk factors associated with disordered eating, including low transgender congruence and internalized transphobia. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Eating disorders; Minority stress; Nonbinary; Transgender","Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Gender Identity; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Mental Health; Transgender Persons; diuretic agent; laxative; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; cognitive defect; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; disease risk assessment; drug use; eating disorder; exercise addiction; female; follow up; gender nonbinary individual; groups by sex; high risk population; human; longitudinal study; low risk population; major clinical study; male; mental development; mental disease; mental health care; mental stress; multicenter study (topic); patient care; prediction; risk factor; symptom; transgender; transphobia; very elderly; eating disorder; gender identity; mental health","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R01HD079603); National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (T32 MH096679); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [ R01-HD079603 from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (Walter Bockting, PI) and T32 MH096679 ].

The objective of this study was to develop community norms for eating disorder attitudes and disordered eating behaviors in transgender men and women using the EDE-Q. Participants were 312 transgender men and 172 transgender women participants in The PRIDE Study, an existing cohort study of sexual and gender minority people. We present mean scores, standard deviations, and percentile ranks for the Global score and four subscale scores of the EDE-Q in transgender men and women. Transgender men and women reported any occurrence (≥1/week) of dietary restraint (25.0% and 27.9%), objective binge episodes (11.2% and 12.8%), excessive exercise (8.0% and 8.1%), self-induced vomiting (1.6% and 1.7%), and laxative misuse (.3% and .6%), respectively. Compared to a prior study of presumed cisgender men 18–26 years (Lavender, De Young, & Anderson, 2010), our age-matched subsample of transgender men reported lower rates of objective binge episodes and excessive exercise. Compared to a prior study of presumed cisgender women 18–42 years (Mond, Hay, Rodgers, & Owen, 2006), we found that an age-matched sample of transgender women reported higher rates of dietary restraint but lower rates of excessive exercise. These norms should aid clinicians in applying and researchers in investigating and interpreting the EDE-Q scores of transgender men and women. © 2020","","Adolescent; Adult; Cohort Studies; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Psychometrics; Surveys and Questionnaires; Transgender Persons; Young Adult; laxative; adult; age; aged; Article; binge eating disorder; cohort analysis; diet restriction; Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire; exercise; female; female to male transgender; high risk population; human; male; male to female transgender; priority journal; sexual and gender minority; vomiting; adolescent; eating disorder; longitudinal study; procedures; psychology; psychometry; questionnaire; transgender; young adult","","","","","Argentine Ministry of Education; Patient‐Centered Out-comes Research Institute, (PPRN‐1501‐26848); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (K23MH115184); National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH; National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA, (K23DA039800); National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK, (K12DK111028); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK; American Heart Association, AHA, (CDA34760281); American Heart Association, AHA; American Academy of Pediatrics, AAP; American Academy of Neurology, AAN; Tourette Association of America, TAA; American Pediatric Society, APS; US-UK Fulbright Commission","Funding text 1: JN was supported by the Pediatric Scientist Development Program ( K12 HD000850 ), the American Academy of Pediatrics , the American Pediatric Society , and the American Heart Association Career Development Award ( CDA34760281 ).

Method: The study includes a sample of Minnesota students (n = 13,906) who participated in the College Student Health Survey from 2015 to 2018. Chi-square tests with bootstrapping examined differences in eating pathology rates between groups. Adjusted logistic regressions tested the association between gender identity, sexual orientation, and self-reported eating outcomes. Results: Chi-square results revealed heightened rates of self-reported AN, self-reported BN, and EAI in cisgender women, transgender or genderqueer, and sexual minority (e.g., lesbian or bisexual) students. Logistic regression analyses in cisgender men and cisgender women revealed higher odds of self-reported AN, self-reported BN, and EAI in sexual minority students relative their heterosexual peers. Chi-square analyses indicated that bisexual cisgender women reported heightened rates of all three eating pathology measures relative to other sexual and/or gender (e.g., transgender) minority students. Discussion: Individuals with marginalized gender and/or sexual orientation identities report heightened rates of eating pathology, with cisgender bisexual women reporting the poorest outcomes relative to individuals from other marginalized identities. Preventive efforts and more research are needed to understand the mechanisms driving this disparity and to reduce prevalence among marginalized groups. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","anorexia nervosa; bulimia nervosa; disparities; gender identity; sexual and gender minorities","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Heterosexuality; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Students; Transgender Persons; Young Adult; academic underachievement; adult; aged; anorexia nervosa; Article; bulimia; college student; eating disorder; female; gender identity; health care survey; heterosexuality; human; LGBTQIA+ people; major clinical study; male; prevalence; priority journal; self report; sexual and gender minority; sexual orientation; social psychology; adolescent; eating disorder; health care disparity; middle aged; psychology; sexual and gender minority; student; transgender; young adult","","","","","National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (T32MH082761); National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH; M.S.I.

However, whether the three clusters of PDs have differences in comorbid mental disorders or gender distribution is still lacking sufficient evidence. We aim to investigate the distribution pattern across the three clusters of PDs with a population-based cohort study. This study used the Taiwan national database between 1995 and 2013 to examine the data of patients with cluster A PDs, cluster B PDs, or cluster C PDs. We compared the differences of psychiatric comorbidities classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition across the three clusters of PDs. Moreover, we formed gender subgroups of the three PDs to observe the discrepancy between male and female. Among the 9845 patients, those with cluster A PDs had the highest proportion of neurodevelopmental disorders, schizophrenia and neurocognitive disorders, those with cluster B PDs demonstrated the largest percentage of bipolar disorders, trauma and stressor disorders, feeding and eating disorders, and substance and addictive disorders, and those with cluster C PDs had the greatest proportion of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive–compulsive disorders, somatic symptom disorders, and sleep–wake disorders. The gender subgroups revealed significant male predominance in neurodevelopmental disorders and female predominance in sleep–wake disorders across all three clusters of PDs. Our findings support that some psychiatric comorbidities are more prevalent in specified cluster PDs and that gender differences exist across the three clusters of PDs. These results are an important reference for clinicians who are developing services that target real-world patients with PDs. © 2021 by the authors.

Little is known about TGD young adult experiences with ED screening and treatment; this qualitative study aimed to address this gap. This study used data from eight asynchronous online focus groups, a dynamic online bulletin board method (N = 66). Participants posted responses to moderator-posed questions over a 4-day period. Participants were TGD young adults ages 18–30 years old, were recruited using social media and outreach to community organizations, and resided in 25 US states. We conducted inductive thematic analysis of all focus group excerpts that described experiences with ED screening or treatment (n = 32). Participants were of diverse gender identities (25% transgender woman, 41% transgender man, 28% non-binary, 6% another gender) and racial/ethnic identities (62% White, 13% Latinx, 13% Multiracial, 6% Asian, 6% Black). Three major themes emerged from the analysis: (1) Barriers to ED screening/treatment; (2) Complexity of the relationship between EDs and gender dysphoria; (3) Need for provider education in gender affirming care practices for ED screening and treatment. Results indicate an ongoing need for gender affirming care for TGD young adults in ED screening and treatment. Health care systems must address barriers to screening and treatment for TGD young adults, including enhancing understanding of the intersection of gender dysphoria and eating disorders as well as improvements in health care provider training. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Eating disorder; Gender diverse; Screening; Transgender; Treatment","Adolescent; Adult; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Gender Identity; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Qualitative Research; Transgender Persons; Young Adult; adult; Article; clinical article; clinical feature; disease course; eating disorder; ethnicity; female; gender dysphoria; gender identity; health care access; human; male; medical education; patient care; priority journal; screening; social media; thematic analysis; transgender; United States; young adult; adolescent; eating disorder; health care personnel; qualitative research","","","","","Health Resources and Services Administration, HRSA; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS, (T71MC00009, UL1TR002541); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS; Harvard Catalyst; Maternal and Child Health Bureau, MCHB","This work was conducted with support from Harvard Catalyst | The Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Center (National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health Award UL 1TR002541 ); and LEAH training grant # T71MC00009 , HRSA/MCHB.

Sexual-minority stress is often discussed as a risk factor for the increased mental health problems reported in this population. Objective: The current study (1) investigated eating attitudes and depressive symptoms in a sexual minority sample from Turkey who identify themselves as LGBTIQ and (2) explored the role of sexual minority stressors beyond the potential predictors of eating attitudes and depressive symptoms in this population. Methods: Recruitment was supported and streamlined by several Turkish NGOs and LGBTIQ community networks. Sociodemographic measures, eating attitudes, depressive symptoms, sexual minority stressors (e.g., heterosexist experiences, internalized homophobia), and the potential predictors of eating attitudes and depressive symptoms were assessed with an anonymous online survey between February 2022 and June 2022. The sample consisted of 440 participants. The mean age was 31.92 (SD = 11.82). The majority of the participants reported their current gender identity as male (64.3%; n = 440) and their sexual orientation as attracted to men (62.8%; n = 439). For 79.7% of the participants, the assigned sex at birth was man (n = 439). Results: Two separate three-stage multiple hierarchical regression analyses were conducted, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and the risk and protective factors of eating attitudes and depressive symptoms. Disturbed eating attitudes were predicted by assigned female sex at birth, higher scores for depression, social isolation, and the total number of heterosexist experiences, and lower distress related to heterosexist experiences. Depressive symptoms were predicted by assigned female sex at birth, lesbian sexual orientation, disturbance in eating attitudes, increases in generalized anxiety, and distress related to daily heterosexist experiences. Conclusion: The current study demonstrated the significant role of sexual minority stressors in the prediction of disturbed eating attitudes and depressive symptomatology beyond the general psychosocial vulnerability factors. These findings emphasize the need for developing strategies to reduce prejudicial attitudes at the societal level and to enhance the skills of LGBTIQ individuals in coping with sexual minority stressors in Turkey.

Methods: This cross-sectional study involved a screening protocol to assess disordered eating and food insecurity risk from September to December of 2019 at a gender clinic using five validated measures: (1) previous eating disorder diagnosis (yes/no); (2) Sick, Control, One Stone, Fat, Food Questionnaire (SCOFF); (3) Adolescent Binge Eating Disorder Questionnaire (ADO-BED); (4) Nine-Item Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder Screen (NIAS); and (5) Hunger Vital Sign. Age, assigned sex at birth, gender identity, stage of medical transition, and body mass index were collected. Pearson's r correlation coefficients, between-groups t-tests, one-way analysis of variance tests, and Tukey's honest significant difference test were used to characterize the relationships between variables. Results: A total of 164 participants ages 12-23 years completed the screener. Using assigned sex at birth, 1.8% were underweight, 53% were a healthy weight, 17.1% were overweight, and 28.0% were obese. An estimated 8.7% reported a previous eating disorder diagnosis, 28.0% screened positive on the SCOFF, 9.1% on the ADO-BED, 75.0% on the NIAS, and 21.2% on the Hunger Vital Sign. Transgender males scored higher on the NIAS than transgender females (p = 0.03). Those with a previous eating disorder diagnosis scored significantly higher on the Hunger Vital Sign (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Gender clinics should routinely screen for disordered eating, food insecurity, overweight, and obesity to identify patients in need of further evaluation and referral.  © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.","adolescence;

To address this research gap, we compared the ability of TGE-specific factors as proposed in the gender minority stress and resilience (GMSR) model, general psychological factors contained in the tripartite influence (TI) model, and an integration of these frameworks to explain body dissatisfaction and disordered eating among TGE individuals. Regression analyses were conducted to test the models’ abilities to explain experiences reported in a survey of 93 U.S. TGE adults, including 43 transgender women respondents (46.2%) and 31 transgender men respondents (33.3%). Participants were diverse with regard to age (M = 34.19, SD = 12.02) and ethnoracial background (e.g., 29.0% Hispanic/Latinx, 17.2% Black/African American, 6.5% American Indian/Alaska Native; 5.4% multiracial). Results demonstrated both models’ abilities to explain body dissatisfaction and disordered eating independently, except for the relationship between body dissatisfaction and the thinness-oriented TI model. An integration of the models better explained body dissatisfaction and disordered eating compared to either model alone. Notably, some findings did not align with the two frameworks, suggesting existing models may not adequately describe pathways through which disordered eating emerges in TGE populations. Specifically, body dissatisfaction showed no significant relationship with disordered eating and was not well explained by the TI model, and higher gender identity pride was related to greater disordered eating symptoms. Implications for clinical care and future research are discussed. © 2022","eating disorders; gender minority stress; LGBTQ+ health; resilience; transgender health","Adult; Body Dissatisfaction; Body Image; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Gender Identity; Humans; Male; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Transgender Persons; adult; Article; body dissatisfaction; Body Image Scale; controlled study; cross-sectional study; discrimination against sexual and gender minorities; eating disorder; female; female to male transgender; gender identity; geography; human; internalization (behavior); LGBT people; male; male to female transgender; peer pressure; physical appearance; physiological stress; psychological resilience; sexual and gender minority; social status; transgender and gender expansive people; United States; body image; psychology; sexual and gender minority; transgender","","","","","Glenn Callaghan; San Jose State University Research Foundation; San José State University, SJSU","Funding text 1: We would like to thank Glenn Callaghan (San José State University) for his comments on project design, Bianca Johnson and Crystal Han for their assistance developing the survey instrument, and our participants for making this research possible.

The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of a new model, description of model-guided integration of multiple methods, documentation of feasibility of recruitment and retention and a description of baseline sample characteristics. Design The research involved a longitudinal, multimethod observational investigation. Setting Participants were recruited from an inpatient child and adolescent psychiatric hospital. 194 participants ages 13-18 were recruited following hospitalisation for STB. Primary and secondary outcome measures Participants underwent a battery of clinical interviews, self-report assessments and venipuncture. On discharge, participants were provided with a phone with (1) the electronically activated recorder (EAR), permitting acoustic capture later coded for social context, and (2) ecological momentary assessment, permitting assessment of in vivo experienced affect and STB. Participants agreed to follow-ups at 3 weeks and 6 months. Results A total of 71.1% of approached patients consented to participation. Participants reported diversity in gender identity (11.6% reported transgender or other gender identity) and sexual orientation (47.6% reported heterosexual or straight sexual orientation). Clinical interviews supported a range of diagnoses with the largest proportion of participants meeting criteria for major depressive disorder (76.9%). History of trauma/maltreatment was prevalent. Enrolment rates and participant characteristics were similar to other observational studies. Conclusions The research protocol characterises in vivo, real-world experienced affect and observed family context as associated with STB in adolescents during the high-risk weeks post discharge, merging multiple fields of study. © 2022 BMJ Publishing Group.

Drug-drug interactions between pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and gender-affirming therapy are cited as a reason for poor PrEP uptake among transwomen. We evaluated plasma tenofovir and emtricitabine pharmacokinetics and their active intracellular anabolites, tenofovir-diphosphate and emtricitabine-triphosphate, in transwomen receiving feminizing hormones. Methods: We enrolled HIV-negative transwomen (≥19 years) not receiving PrEP. Participants took oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine 300/200 mg daily for 14 days. Plasma was collected at 0 h (pre-dose), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12 h on day 14 post-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine dose. The plasma AUC0-24 was calculated using the trapezoidal rule and compared with historical HIV-negative cisgender adults as geometric mean ratios (GMRs, 90% CI). Secondarily, tenofovir-diphosphate and emtricitabine-triphosphate from PBMCs collected at 0 h and 12 h were reported descriptively as geometric means (90% CI). Clinical trials registration: NCT03270969. Results: Among 15 transwomen (mean age 32 years), geometric mean tenofovir and emtricitabine plasma AUC0-24 were lower compared with controls: tenofovir, 2.10 versus 2.76 mg·h/L, GMR 0.76 (0.65-0.90), P = 0.01; emtricitabine, 9.15 versus 10.64 mg·h/L, GMR 0.86 (0.75-0.98), P = 0.07. Tenofovir-diphosphate and emtricitabine-triphosphate concentrations were higher than previously reported in the literature: 167.1 (146.6-190.5) fmol/106 cells and 15.4 (13.8-17.3) pmol/106 cells, respectively. Conclusions: We observed lower plasma tenofovir and emtricitabine concentrations in transwomen compared with historical cisgender adults, yet intracellular tenofovir-diphosphate and emtricitabine-triphosphate concentrations were higher than previously reported in PBMCs. Understanding the differences of PrEP pharmacokinetics in plasma and tissue compartments and the resultant impact on efficacy remains important for transwomen. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

This study explored the lived experiences of TNB people with atypical anorexia by examining how gender identity impacted experiences of ED illness and (potential) recovery. Nine TNB adults with atypical anorexia were followed for one year and completed semi-structured, in-depth, longitudinal qualitative interviews at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Interviews were coded using Braun and Clark’s thematic analysis procedures. Four themes, along with subthemes, emerged regarding the intersection of gender identity and ED experiences: (1) Conforming, (2) Coping, (3) Connecting, and (4) Critiquing. In Conforming, participants highlighted how societal pressures around gender contributed to ED vulnerability. In Coping, participants explained that their EDs represented attempts to cope with the overlapping influences of body dissatisfaction, gender dysphoria, and body disconnection. In Connecting, participants described ED recovery as a process of connecting to self, others, and communities that welcomed and affirmed their diverse identities. In Critiquing, participants described how current ED treatment settings were often unwelcoming of or unprepared for non-cisgender patients. Overall, participants viewed their EDs as intricately linked to their gender identity and experiences of social pressure and discrimination. This study suggests the need for targeted ED prevention and intervention efforts within TNB communities, and the ethical imperative to meaningfully address the needs of TNB patients in ED treatment settings. © 2023 by the authors.","atypical anorexia; body image; eating disorders; gender; nonbinary; transgender","Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Anorexia; Female; Gender Identity; Humans; Male; Transgender Persons; Transsexualism; body shape; diet; gender disparity; gender identity; mental disorder; adult; anorexia; Article; body dissatisfaction; clinical article; clinical feature; conformity (social behavior); coping behavior; female; gender dysphoria; gender identity; human; male; risk factor; semi structured interview; social discrimination; anorexia; coping behavior; transgender; transsexualism","","","","","RSH; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (TL1 TR002318); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS; Academy for Eating Disorders, AED","This research was funded by the National Center For Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number TL1 TR002318, through an RSH Dissertation Grant through the Academy of Eating Disorders, and through a Health at Every Size® Expansion Grant through the Association for Size Diversity and Health.

Methods: Data from 5057 TGD college students participating in the national Healthy Minds Study between 2014 and 2019 were analyzed. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses examined heterogeneity in prevalence and odds of elevated eating disorder risk, as measured by the SCOFF, and self-reported eating disorder diagnosis by gender, as well as by intersecting gender and sexual orientation identities. Results: Genderqueer and/or non-conforming college students reported the highest prevalence of elevated eating disorder risk (38.8%) relative to gender expansive students. Genderqueer and/or non-conforming (11.1%), gender expansive (12.3%), and trans men and/or transmasculine students (10.5%) reported higher prevalence of a self-reported eating disorder diagnosis relative to trans women and/or transfeminine students (6.3%). Heterosexual or straight trans men had lower odds of eating disorder risk and self-reported diagnosis relative to trans men with a minoritized sexual orientation. Conclusions: Genderqueer and/or non-conforming college students may be at heightened eating disorder risk. Moreover, a heterosexual and/or straight sexual orientation was associated with lower odds of elevated eating disorder risk and self-reported eating disorder diagnoses among trans men and genderqueer and/or non-conforming college students, but this finding did not hold for other groups. College campuses should aim to reduce eating disorder risk among TGD students. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Disparities; Eating disorders; Sexual orientation; Transgender","Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Gender Identity; Humans; Male; Students; Transgender Persons; Universities; adult; Article; college student; controlled study; eating disorder; female; gender identity; heterosexuality; human; major clinical study; male; prevalence; risk factor; sexual orientation; transgender; eating disorder; student; transgender; university","","","","","National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (T32MH082761); National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, NIMHD, (K01 MH121515)","Melissa Simone's time and research are supported by K99 MD015770 (PI: Simone) from the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities.

The factors under study were self-objectification, body dissatisfaction, shame-proneness, guilt-proneness, positive minority identity, and a sense of connectedness to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community. Nongovernmental organizations that advocate for LGBT individuals assisted in the recruitment of participants. Data were analyzed through a hierarchical multiple regression, and age, education level, socioeconomic status, and religious affiliation were controlled for. The control variables alone explained 6% of the variance, and the six variables of interest within this study explained an additional 25% after being entered into the model. Self-objectification and shame-proneness were significantly, positively related to disordered eating among the participants in this study. In contrast to prior research, body dissatisfaction was not significantly associated with disordered eating in the present study. Results of this study indicate that self-objectification and shame-proneness might be important issues to consider in clinical work with gay Lebanese men exhibiting disordered eating symptomatology. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Disordered eating; Lebanon; Self-objectification; Sexual minority; Shame-proneness","Body Image; Cross-Sectional Studies; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Humans; Lebanon; Male; Sexual and Gender Minorities; adult; Article; body dissatisfaction; controlled study; eating disorder; homosexual male; human; Lebanon; LGBT people; male; medical research; middle aged; non-governmental organization; priority journal; questionnaire; religion; religious affiliation; self objectification; Self Objectification Questionnaire; self report; social status; young adult; body image; cross-sectional study; eating disorder; female; sexual and gender minority","","","","","Marsa Sexual Health Center","We would like to thank the staff at the nongovernmental organizations of LebMASH, Marsa Sexual Health Center, MOSAIC, and Proud Lebanon for their support and assistance in the participant recruitment and data collection processes.

The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, which dictates puberty and sexual maturation, including bone growth, is sensitive to metabolic changes such as those in eating disorders. Consequences may include pubertal delay/arrest, stunted growth, weakened bones, menstrual changes, impotence, sexual dysfunction, infertility, or adverse pregnancy outcomes. The physical and psychological impacts of eating disorders can also affect intimate relationships and sexual satisfaction. Visits to mental health providers offer an opportunity to assess the development and reproductive health concerns of patients with eating disorders. The purpose of this article is to review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and morbidities of the reproductive sequelae of eating disorders and to educate mental health providers on when to refer patients for further medical evaluation.

Prior traumas and PTSD also are reported to occur significantly more frequently in individuals identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, non-binary, or other (LGBTQ+), but little is known about rates of PTSD in LGBTQ+ individuals with EDs admitted to residential treatment (RT). Method: Our sample included 542 adults with DSM-5 EDs admitted to RT at seven sites in the U.S. Rates of current presumptive PTSD (PTSD +) by LGBTQ + status were determined by responses on the Life Events Checklist (LEC-5) and the PTSD Symptom Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Results: Nearly 24% of admitting individuals self-reported as LGBTQ+, and these individuals had significantly higher LEC-5 total scores (5.6 v. 4.9), PCL-5 total scores (41.9 v. 34.0), and rates of PTSD+ (63% v. 45%) than non-LGBTQ+ individuals. The LGBTQ+ with PTSD+ group reported (1) significantly more unwanted sexual experiences, sexual assaults, physical assaults, and severe human suffering experiences, and (2) significantly greater ED, depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms than the non-LGBTQ+ group with PTSD+. Conclusions: LGBTQ+ individuals had significantly higher rates of high impact lifetime traumas and presumptive PTSD+, as well as greater ED and comorbid symptom severity, than non-LGBTQ+ individuals. Development, implementation and assessment of integrated treatment protocols for LGBTQ+ individuals with an ED and PTSD+ is warranted to address the needs of this underserved and often overlooked population. Level of evidence: Level III: Evidence obtained from cohort or case–control analytic studies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Eating disorders; LGBTQ+;

Although research supports the psychometric properties of existing ED screens for identifying cases of EDs, most studies have been conducted in samples of young white-majority women or have not reported the psychometric properties of the screening tool in men. Objective: The purpose of the current study was to validate a brief, 10-item screening tool for the identification of EDs—the brief assessment of stress and eating (BASE). Method: Participants were college students (N = 596; 68.2% cisgender women) from a large Midwestern university who completed the BASE and SCOFF. The Eating Disorders Diagnostic Survey was used to generate DSM-5 ED diagnoses. We evaluated area under the curve (AUC) for both receiver operating curves (ROC) and precision-recall curves (PRC). Results: Both the BASE and SCOFF performed significantly better than chance at identifying probable EDs in cisgender women (BASE AUC: ROC =.787, PRC =.633, sensitivity =.733, specificity =.697; SCOFF AUC: ROC =.810, PRC =.684, sensitivity =.793, specificity =.701). However, the BASE (AUC: ROC =.821, PRC =.605, sensitivity =.966, specificity =.495) significantly outperformed the SCOFF (AUC: ROC =.710, PRC =.354, sensitivity =.828, specificity =.514) for identifying probable EDs in cisgender college men. Discussion: The BASE is appropriate for student healthcare and college research settings. Because the BASE outperforms the SCOFF in college men, results from the current study are expected to contribute to improved identification of EDs on college campuses. Public Significance: The BASE is a new screening tool to identify eating disorders. The BASE performed as well as, if not better than, the SCOFF (particularly in men). Given the need for brief, psychometrically strong, and unbiased ED screening tools in college students, the current study helps address an unmet student healthcare need that we expect will contribute to improved identification of EDs on college campuses. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","assessment; BASE; Brief Assessment of Stress and Eating; college students; disordered eating; eating disorders; men; screening; self-report measures","Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Humans; Male; Mass Screening; Psychometrics; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Universities; adult; area under the curve; Article; body mass; clinical assessment; college student; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; DSM-5; eating; eating disorder; Eating Disorder Diagnostic Scale; Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory; female; health care need; human; Inventory for Depression and Anxiety Symptoms-II; male; mental disease assessment; normal human; physiological stress; predictive value; questionnaire; receiver operating characteristic; self report; stress assessment; test retest reliability; transgender; validation process; eating disorder; mass screening; procedures; psychometry; student; university","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS, (TL1TR002368); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS; University of Kansas, KU; Frontiers Clinical and Translational Science Institute, University of Kansas, KU CTSI","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the University of Kansas Research Excellence Initiative Grant awarded to Kelsie Forbush.

A retrospective chart review of four gender minority youth (GMY), age 14-17, was performed for gender identity history, type and success of menstrual suppression, method satisfaction, side effects and improvement in menstrual distress. Menstrual suppression was successful in three patients, one patient discontinued use due to side effects that caused an increase in gender dysphoria. Menstrual distress and bleeding pattern improved in the majority of GMY in this series but side effects, as well as contraindications, may limit their use. In conclusion, menstrual dysphoria can be life-threatening for GMY and it is important that clinicians consider menstrual suppression in GMY with menstrual dysphoria. This series emphasizes the importance of individualized treatment plans. © 2022.","Gender minority youth; menstrual suppression; menstural dysphoria","estradiol; estrogen; gonadotropin; luteinizing hormone; adolescent; amenorrhea; anxiety; Article; bleeding; depression; eating disorder; endometriosis; female; gender dysphoria; gender identity; human; male; menstrual cycle; Menstrual Suppression; parental consent; physiological stress; premenstrual dysphoric disorder; premenstrual syndrome; retrospective study; seizure; side effect","","estradiol, 50-28-2; gonadotropin, 63231-54-9; luteinizing hormone, 39341-83-8, 9002-67-9","","","","","Apali OC, Baba I, Bayrakci F, Degerli D, Erden A, Peker MS, Perk FG, Sipahi IS, Senoglu E, Yilmaz S, Zengin NY, Akgul S., Experience of sexual and gender minority youth when accessing health care in Turkey, Int J Adolesc Med Health, 33, pp. 445-448, (2020); Reisner SL, Greytak EA, Parsons JT, Ybarra ML., Gender minority social stress in adolescence: disparities in adolescent bullying and substance use by gender identity, J Sex Res, 52, pp. 243-256, (2015); Levine DA, Office-based care for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning youth, Pediatrics, 132, pp. 297-313, (2013); Olson J, Forbes C, Belzer M., Management of the transgender adolescent, Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med, 165, pp. 171-176, (2011); Frank SE., Queering Menstruation: Trans and Non‐Binary Identity and Body Politics, Sociological Inquiry, 90, pp. 371-404, (2020); Kanj RV, Conard LAE, Corathers SD, Trotman GE., Hormonal contraceptive choices in a clinic-based series of transgender adolescents and young adults, Int J Transgend, 20, pp. 413-420, (2019); Lowik AJ., ‘’Just because I don’t bleed, doesn’t mean I don’t go through it”: Expanding knowledge on trans and nonbinary menstruators, Int J Transgend Health, 22, pp. 113-125, (2021); Akgul S, Bonny AE, Ford N, Holland-Hall C, Chelvakumar G., Experiences of Gender Minority Youth With the Intrauterine System, J Adolesc Health, 65, pp. 32-38, (2019); Coleman E, Bockting W, Botzer M, Cohen-Kettenis P, DeCuypere G, Feldman J, Fraser L, Green J, Knudson G, Meyer W, .

Data were collected from 249 treatment-seeking TG youth, Ages 11-24. Results indicate that one general eating disorder factor was a tenable solution for all items on the EDE-Q for both TG women, TG men, and the combined sample. Also, no mean difference was found between TG women and TG men on the total EDE-Q. Results suggested the performance of the EDE-Q in a sample of treatmentseeking TG youth are similar to those observed in previously published cisgender female samples. Because the findings from this study demonstrated that a total score for the EDE-Q is better used among treatment-seeking TG youth, it is tentatively recommended to not consider subscale scores, but replications are needed. Our findings highlight the importance of this area of study for both researchers and clinicians, because of the dearth of information about the EDE-Q when used with treatment-seeking TG youth. A critical next step is to consider whether the EDE-Q is measuring salient experiences and diagnostic classifications related to eating disorders in treatment-seeking TG youth. © 2020 American Psychological Association.","Eating disorder examination questionnaire (EDE-Q); Factor analysis; Gender dysphoria; Transgender youth","","","","","","Academic and Research Council; Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center","Partial funding for this study was provided by a grant from the Academic and Research Council, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.

Although parental care and overprotection in childhood influence later attachment and mental health in the general adult population, this has not been investigated in the autistic population. Likewise, the roles of psychological inflexibility and social engagement in influencing mental health outcomes for autistic adults have yet to be examined. Aims: To examine if retrospectively recalled childhood experiences of parental care and overprotection, as well as current adult attachment, psychological inflexibility and social engagement are associated with mental health in autistic adulthood. Further, to examine mediators of the association between parental care and overprotection and mental health in autistic adults. Methods and procedures: A community-recruited convenience sample of 126 Australian autistic adults completed an online survey assessing childhood experiences of parental care and overprotection and current adult attachment, psychological inflexibility, social engagement, and mental health. Outcomes and results: Linear regressions showed that psychological inflexibility was the strongest predictor of depression, anxiety, and stress, followed by attachment anxiety (depression, anxiety) and attachment avoidance (anxiety, stress). Mediation analyses revealed that psychological inflexibility and attachment anxiety mediated the associations between parental care and overprotection and mental health outcomes in autistic adulthood. Conclusions and implications: Psychological inflexibility and adult attachment (anxious and avoidant attachment) are important to understanding mental health of autistic adults. Psychological inflexibility and attachment anxiety mediate associations between recalled childhood experiences of parental care and overprotection and mental health in autistic adulthood. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Attachment; Autism; Parenting; Psychological flexibility","Adult; Anxiety; Australia; Autistic Disorder; Humans; Mental Health; Parenting; Retrospective Studies; Social Participation; adult; anxiety; anxiety disorder; apraxia; Article; Asperger syndrome; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Australian; autism; bipolar disorder; body dysmorphic disorder; caregiver; cerebral palsy; childhood adversity; community; convenience sample; cross-sectional study; data analysis; demographics; depression; Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale; developmental delay; drug dependence; eating disorder; education; emotional attachment; employment; family history; female; female to male transgender; gender dysphoria; health care personnel; high school; human; income; intellectual impairment; learning disorder; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; male; male to female transgender; married person; mediation analysis; mental health; multiple personality; obsessive compulsive disorder; outcome assessment; parental behavior; personality disorder; physiological stress; postgraduate education; posttraumatic stress disorder; prediction; primary school; questionnaire; retrospective study; schizophrenia; separated person; single (marital status); social participation; social status; tic; transgender; vocational education; Australia; child parent relation; psychology; social participation","","","","","Children's Hospital Foundation, CHF, (50223, ECF0112020); University of Queensland, UQ","Funding text 1: The Parenting and Family Support Centre is partly funded by royalties stemming from published resources of the Triple P – Positive Parenting Program, which is developed and owned by The University of Queensland (UQ).

Youth may differ in the presence and severity of these underlying core features, and matching intervention strategies to such features may help personalize transdiagnostic interventions. We used latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify profiles of youth based on core underlying transdiagnostic dysfunctions and examined associations of profiles with treatment outcome. Method: LPA was conducted with 298 youth ages 7–18.8 (Mage = 12, SD = 3.2; 48.7% female; primarily White and Hispanic/Latinx) with a primary emotional disorder. Indicators for LPA included self-report measures of affect, anxiety sensitivity (AS), distress tolerance (DT), and emotion regulation (ER). Longitudinal associations between profile membership and treatment outcome were examined in a subset of 177 youth (Mage = 11.8, SD = 3.2; 52% female; primarily White and Hispanic/Latinx). Results: LPA identified three profiles characterized by differing levels of DT, affect, and ER. A Moderately Distressed and Dysregulated profile had the largest membership (65.1%) and poorer youth-reported anxiety and depression outcomes compared to a Distress Tolerant, Regulated Expressive profile (24.9%). A Distressed, High Affect Avoidant profile (10%) had the greatest baseline severity and the poorest depression outcomes, although most youth improved. Conclusions: Youth characterized by certain profiles of transdiagnostic core processes appear to have the poorest functioning and treatment prognosis, although most youth improved. Targeting these processes more directly and/or earlier in treatment may help to improve outcomes for youth © 2022.

Materials and methods: Retrospective chart review among 52 adolescents who came into gender identity assessment before age 18, were diagnosed with transsexualism and started hormonal gender reassignment. The subjects were followed over the so-called real-life phase of gender reassignment. Results: Those who did well in terms of psychiatric symptoms and functioning before cross-sex hormones mainly did well during real-life. Those who had psychiatric treatment needs or problems in school, peer relationships and managing everyday matters outside of home continued to have problems during real-life. Conclusion: Medical gender reassignment is not enough to improve functioning and relieve psychiatric comorbidities among adolescents with gender dysphoria. Appropriate interventions are warranted for psychiatric comorbidities and problems in adolescent development. © 2019, © 2019 The Nordic Psychiatric Association.","adolescence; adolescent development; cross-sex hormones; Gender dysphoria; transsexualism","Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Adolescent Development; Female; Finland; Gender Dysphoria; Gender Identity; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Humans; Male; Psychotherapy; Retrospective Studies; Transsexualism; sex hormone; sex hormone; adolescent; adolescent development; anxiety disorder; Article; attention deficit disorder; autism; comorbidity; conduct disorder; depression; eating disorder; female; gender dysphoria; gender identity; health care need; human; major clinical study; male; medical record review; peer group; psychiatric treatment; psychosis; retrospective study; school; sex reassignment; sexual development; sexual intercourse; social psychology; substance abuse; suicidal behavior; transgender; transsexualism; adolescent behavior; adolescent development; drug effect; Finland; gender dysphoria; physiology; procedures; psychology; psychotherapy; transsexualism","","Gonadal Steroid Hormones, ","","","","","Blos P., The adolescent passage: developmental issues, (1979); Steinberg L., Cognitive and affective development in adolescence, Trends Cogn Sci, 9, pp. 69-74, (2005); Paus T., Keshavan M., Giedd J.N., Why do many psychiatric disorders emerge during adolescence?, Nat Rev Neurosci, 9, pp. 947-957, (2008); Havighurst R.J., Deelopmental tasks and education, (1948); Palombo J., Bendicksen H.K., Koch B.J., Guide to psychoanalytic developmental theories, (2009); Erikson E.H., Childhood and society, (1950); Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, (2013); The ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioural disorders: clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines, (1992); Seiffge-Krenke I., Gelhaar T., Does successful attainment of developmental tasks lead to happiness and success in later developmental tasks?

Methods: Employing a convergent mixed method design, we surveyed 411 individuals, and conducted qualitative semi-structured follow-up interviews with 43 LGBTQ+ -identifying survey respondents. Using OLS regression and multinomial logistic regression, we modeled eating disorder symptoms and perceived weight gain among LGBTQ+ individuals (n = 120) and cisgender and heterosexual-identifying women (n = 230), to cisgender and heterosexual-identifying men (n = 61). We also explored complementary interview narratives among LGBTQ+ people by employing selective coding strategies. Results: Study results suggest that LGBTQ+ individuals are likely experiencing uniquely high levels of pandemic-related stress, and secondly, that pandemic-related stress is associated with elevated eating disorder symptoms and higher risk of perceived weight gain. Nearly 1 in 3 participants reported eating disorder symptoms of potentially clinical significance. Social support, but not resilient coping, was found to be protective against increased eating disorder symptoms. Qualitative analyses revealed that LGBTQ+ individuals situated physical exercise constraints, challenging eating patterns, and weight concerns within their pandemic experiences. Conclusions: Clinicians of diverse specialties should screen for eating disorder symptoms and actively engage patients in conversations about their COVID-19-related weight gain and eating behaviors, particularly with LGBTQ+ -identifying adults. © 2021, The Author(s).","COVID-19; EDE-QS; LGBTQ; Weight gain","","","","","","Department of Sociology, Ohio State University","This study was supported by internal funds from Oklahoma State University\u2019s Department of Sociology.

The present study aimed to address these research gaps by examining whether pandemic-related changes in ED symptoms and mental healthcare prevalence differed for historically marginalized groups within a national sample of US college students. Method: Participants included 242,906 US college students (Mage = 23.45, SD = 7.04; MBMI = 25.28, SD = 5.91) who completed the repeated cross-sectional multi-institute Healthy Minds Study between January 2019 and May 2021. Moderated logistic regressions examined whether pandemic-related changes in individuals' likelihoods of exhibiting current probable ED, reporting lifetime ED diagnoses, and—among individuals with current probable ED—mental healthcare engagement differed for diverse gender, sexual, and racial/ethnic identity groups, and by body mass index (BMI) and financial stress. Results: There were increases of 5% and 12% in individuals' likelihoods of exhibiting current probable ED and symptomatic individuals' mental healthcare engagement, respectively, pre- to post-COVID-19 onset, but no pandemic-related changes in lifetime ED diagnosis prevalence. There were also important variations in these time-trends for different marginalized groups. For example, individuals identifying as genderqueer/gender nonconforming and lesbian exhibited increasing ED symptoms pre- to post-COVID-19 onset, and individuals with current probable ED and higher BMIs were increasingly likely to receive mental healthcare. Associations between financial stress, and the ED and mental healthcare outcomes did not change over time. Discussion: These findings provide insight into groups of US college students that experienced disproportionate ED burden during the pandemic at the population level, and directions for research and interventions that warrant consideration. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","disordered eating; eating disorders; mental health; young adults","Adult; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Humans; Mental Health Services; Pandemics; Students; Young Adult; anorexia nervosa; Article; body mass; bulimia; clinical outcome; college student; coronavirus disease 2019; eating disorder; ethnic identity; ethnicity; female; financial stress; gender; gender identity; homosexual female; human; human experiment; long COVID; male; mental health; mental health care; pandemic; prevalence; psychiatrist; questionnaire; SCOFF questionnaire; sexual orientation; transgender and gender nonbinary; United States; adult; cross-sectional study; eating disorder; mental health service; pandemic; student; young adult","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (F31MH120982); National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH; William T.

We hypothesized that youth with gender dysphoria would have higher odds of having psychiatric and neurodevelopmental diagnoses than controls. Study design: All youth with a diagnosis of gender dysphoria (n = 4173 age at last visit 16.2 ± 3.4) and at least 1 outpatient encounter were extracted from the PEDSnet database and propensity-score matched on 8 variables to controls without gender dysphoria (n = 16 648, age at last visit 16.2 ± 4.8) using multivariable logistic regression. The odds of having psychiatric and neurodevelopmental diagnoses were examined using generalized estimating equations. Results: Youth with gender dysphoria had higher odds of psychiatric (OR 4.0 [95% CI 3.8, 4.3] P < .0001) and neurodevelopmental diagnoses (1.9 [1.7, 2.0], P < .0001). Youth with gender dysphoria were more likely to have a diagnosis across all psychiatric disorder subcategories, with particularly high odds of mood disorder (7.3 [6.8, 7.9], P < .0001) and anxiety (5.5 [5.1, 5.9], P < .0001). Youth with gender dysphoria had a greater odds of autism spectrum disorder (2.6, [2.2, 3.0], P < .0001). Conclusions: Youth with gender dysphoria at large pediatric health systems have greater odds of psychiatric and several neurodevelopmental diagnoses compared with youth without gender dysphoria. Further studies are needed to evaluate changes in mental health over time with access to gender affirming care. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","ADHD; anxiety; autism; depression; eating disorder; gender dysphoria; mood disorder; neurodevelopment; psychiatric; transgender","Adolescent; Anxiety; Case-Control Studies; Child; Female; Gender Dysphoria; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Mood Disorders; Neurodevelopmental Disorders; Odds Ratio; Propensity Score; Risk Factors; Young Adult; adolescent; anxiety disorder; Article; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; autism; automutilation; child; conduct disorder; controlled study; developmental delay; developmental disorder; developmental language disorder; eating disorder; electronic health record; female; gender dysphoria; heart atrium septum defect; human; impulse control disorder; intellectual impairment; juvenile; learning disorder; major clinical study; male; mental disease; mood disorder; motor dysfunction; personality disorder; psychiatric diagnosis; psychosis; speech disorder; tic; anxiety; case control study; complication; gender dysphoria; mental disease; mood disorder; odds ratio; propensity score; psychology; risk factor; statistical model; young adult","","","","","DSM.19 In hospital systems; Nationwide Children's Hospital, St. Louis Children's Hospital; Stoneleigh Foundation; National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (K23HD092588); National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD; Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, DDCF; Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, PCORI, (RI-CRN-2020-007); Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, PCORI; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (K12HD057022, R03HD102773); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD; Seattle Children’s Hospital, SCH","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by NIH / Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development K23HD092588 and R03HD102773 (to S.D.), NIH / Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development K12HD057022 (to N.N.), Doris Duke Foundation (to S.D., and N.N.), the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute ( RI-CRN-2020-007 ) ([to F.C.]), and the Seattle Children’s Institute Career Development Award (to G.S.).

Six pediatric health systems participated in this PEDSnet dataset, collectively including over 6 million children: Children's Hospital Colorado, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Nemours Children's Health System, Nationwide Children's Hospital, St. Louis Children's Hospital, and Seattle Children's Hospital. Clinical data are available from the electronic health record (EHR) of these health systems from 2009 onward for patients with an in-person encounter with a provider. All youth (age range 3.4-28.5 years at last visit) with a diagnosis of gender dysphoria (by PEDSnet concept ID, Table I (available at www.jpeds.com) includes codes extracted from the EHR problem list or diagnosis code from any encounter) and at least 1 outpatient visit from 2009-2019 were extracted from the PEDSnet database in November 2019. Gender dysphoria is a diagnosis in the DSM-5, which was released in 2013,4 and Gender Identity Disorder was the prior related diagnosis in the 4th edition of the DSM.19 In hospital systems, other diagnosis codes are often used based on the International Classification of Diseases or ICD system. Cases with a diagnosis of gender dysphoria were selected based on one of 32 PEDSnet Concept IDs (Table I). A random sample of 197 042 patients with at least 1 outpatient visit in the same time period who did not have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria were used as a pool of controls. To ensure these controls were representative of the general PEDSnet population, we evaluated the prevalence of well characterized pediatric diagnoses (asthma, type 1 diabetes, and acute lymphoid leukemia) to ensure the prevalence in the controls was similar to PEDSnet as a whole. We chose 1 outpatient visit as a criterion for cases and controls to not oversample from those who were only seen in the health systems for urgent/emergent care.We thank the PEDSnet Data Coordinating Center for their support in the data acquisition and all PEDSnet site contributors. We also thank the team at the Adult and Child Consortium for Health Outcomes Research and Delivery Science including prior analysts Jacob Thomas, Bridget Mosley, and Angela Moss, who worked on data cleaning and the early analyses, and Elizabeth Juarez-Colunga who helped develop the initial analysis plan.

We also incorporated appearance congruence, or the degree to which an individual personally feels that their gender expression matches their gender identity, into the objectification theory model. Results of a structural equation model using data from a sample of 173 trans women from the United States indicated that the basic objectification theory model held among this sample and that appearance congruence was associated negatively with body surveillance. However, appearance congruence did not have significant direct or indirect links (via body surveillance and body shame) with disordered eating or intention to obtain silicone injections. Thus, disordered eating and intention to obtain silicone injections are potential negative outcomes of the process of objectification among trans women, and appearance congruence does not appear to be uniquely linked to health risks associated with internalization of cultural standards of attractiveness, body surveillance, and body shame. Our findings support the application of the tenets of objectification theory with trans women as they apply to disordered eating and intention to obtain silicone injections and also indicate the need to identify other positive influences on trans women’s body image to counteract internalization of cultural standards of attractiveness. © The Author(s) 2019.","body image;

However, intermittent fasting has also been shown to relate to eating disorder behaviors and psychopathology, yet little research has explored this relationship in epidemiological samples. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine prevalence and characteristics of engagement in intermittent fasting, and associations with eating disorder behaviors and psychopathology. Data from the Canadian Study of Adolescent Health Behaviors, a national study of Canadian adolescents and young adults (N = 2762) were analyzed. Multiple modified Poisson regression analyses were conducted to determine the association between intermittent fasting (past 12 months and 30 days) and eating disorder behaviors and psychopathology (measured using the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire). Overall, 47.7 % of women, 38.4 % of men, and 52.0 % of transgender/gender non-conforming (TGNC) participants reported engaging in intermittent fasting in the past 12 months. Intermittent fasting in the past 12 months and 30 days was significantly associated with eating disorder psychopathology among women, men, and TGNC participants. Varying patterns of association between intermittent fasting and eating disorder behaviors were found across genders, with the most consistent relationships between intermittent fasting and ED behaviors in women. Findings underscore the common nature of intermittent fasting among a large, community sample of adolescents and young adults across Canada, as well as associated eating disorder behaviors and psychopathology. Continued research is needed to further understand the effects of intermittent fasting, as clinical and public health efforts are needed to protect the health of adolescent and young adults. © 2022","Adolescents; Canada; Eating disorders; Intermittent fasting; Young adults","Adolescent; Canada; Fasting; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Feeding Behavior; Female; Humans; Male; Psychopathology; Young Adult; laxative; adolescent; adolescent behavior; analysis of variance; Article; Canada; Canadian; community sample; cross-sectional study; eating disorder; Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire; educational status; ethnicity; exercise addiction; feeding behavior; female; heterosexuality; human; intermittent fasting; LGBTQIA+ people; major clinical study; male; mental disease; obesity; Poisson regression; prevalence; public health; race; transgender and gender nonbinary; underweight; vomiting; young adult; diet restriction; eating disorder; mental disease","","","","","University of Toronto, U of T, (512586)","The authors would like to thank Ali Raza Hasan Ali and Lynn Nguyen for providing editorial and research assistance.

Several studies have highlighted how this suffering has psychological, physical, and biological implications. This work aims to explore experiences related to body dissatisfaction and investigate the issues associated with living in a body perceived as incongruent for individuals with GI. Thirty-six individuals, aged between 18 and 30 years old and at stage T0 of hormone treatment, participated in the study. Body dissatisfaction and experiences related to it were investigated using the Clinical Diagnostic Interview. The Consensual Qualitative Research methodology was applied to the transcripts of the interviews. Several themes emerged: experiences with GI development, experiences with puberty and bodily changes, perception of one’s body, psychological problems and complex behavioral patterns related to body dissatisfaction. Results pointed out the complexity implied in the relationship with one’s body for individuals with GI, highlighting specific aspects of body dissatisfaction among these individuals (e.g., eating disorders, sexual difficulties, social withdrawal). This study underlines the need for a deeper understanding of some aspects of GI to better define guidelines for a correct assessment of it. In this way it will be easier to avoid negative outcomes for the psychological and general health of transgender people. © 2020 by the authors.

Supportive acceptance from a known PPCP can facilitate medical and psychosocial supports that will enable TGD youth to live their authentic gender experience at home, at school, and in their community. • Based on strong recommendations B, C, and D, a pediatric gender-affirmative care model acknowledges an individual's unique gender experience within their developmental process. It naturally builds on the family-centered, strength-based focus of primary care pediatrics to foster positive development through open communication, empathy, and resiliency. • Based on strong recommendations B and C, transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) youth may present to the clinical setting with heightened distress as they go through the physical and emotional changes of puberty. TGD youth may not explicitly identify gender concerns but might instead exhibit high-risk behaviors and social disengagement (eg, school failure, social isolation, substance use, self-harm, disordered eating, high-risk sexual behaviors). • Based on strong recommendations C, D, and X, PPCPs play an essential role in identifying and normalizing gender diversity early so that family support and understanding can be established. This is achieved through routine gender screening and anticipatory guidance throughout childhood. • Based on strong recommendations C, D, and X, early identification provides increased engagement and support, timely targeted planning and treatment options, and an increased likelihood that the TGD youth's ongoing development will be congruent with their asserted gender identity. • Based on strong recommendations B, C, D, and X, there is growing understanding and research regarding best practice in gender care for children and adolescents. This knowledge base will continue to evolve, but current best practices support a gender-affirmative approach throughout childhood and adolescence. Approaches that force children to suppress rather than explore their authentic self, or that deny access to appropriate medical care and emotional supports, are detrimental to childhood health and well-being.

While research suggests that romantic partners have the potential to support ED recovery, partners to those with EDs often report feeling confused and helpless in the face of the condition. The extant literature on EDs in relationships centers on the experiences of cisgender, heterosexual women. The present study aimed to garner a more comprehensive understanding of the types of support people with EDs believe are most helpful from romantic partners by analyzing relationship advice from a diverse group of individuals with EDs who were in romantic relationships. As part of a larger study on romantic relationships in ED recovery, we analyzed responses to the question, “If you had to give one piece of advice to someone who learns that their partner has an ED, what would it be?” Through Consensual Qualitative Research-Modified, we identified 29 themes, which we grouped into 7 domains: Foster Open Communication, Create an Environment of Emotional Intimacy, Let Your Partner Guide You, Educate Yourself, Be Compassionate with Yourself, Use Caution when Discussing Food and Bodies, and a Miscellaneous domain. These findings highlight the importance of patience, flexibility, psychoeducation, and self-compassion for individuals working to support their partner’s ED recovery, and can inform future couples-based treatments and interventions for EDs. © 2023 Taylor & Francis.","","Communication; Emotions; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Sexual Partners; adult; anorexia nervosa; Article; avoidant restrictive food intake disorder; binge eating disorder; body image; bulimia; clinician; eating disorder; emotion; ethnicity; female; human; human experiment; human relation; interpersonal communication; intervention study; male; marriage; mental health; monogamy; normal human; patience; psychoeducation; qualitative analysis; qualitative research; race; self compassion; sexual orientation; sexuality; stereotypy; transgender; eating disorder; human relation; psychology; sexuality","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS, (5T34GM008303); National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS","The research team would like to acknowledge their own partners, who inspired and supported this project from start to finish.

We studied the somatic health, pubertal development, psychosocial background, and interest regarding gender-affirming surgical treatment of Finnish adolescents seeking gender-affirming hormonal treatment (GAHT). Methods: In this retrospective register study at an adolescent gynecology clinic in Helsinki University Hospital, Finland we included 124 adolescents diagnosed with GD and referred to GAHT between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2018. This cohort covered two thirds of all Finnish adolescents referred to GAHT during the follow-up. Data on the general adolescent population were obtained from the Finnish School Health Promotion (SHP) study of year 2017. Results: Most adolescents were assigned female at birth. Sex ratio increased from 1.2 in 2012 to 5.2 in 2017. One-third of the patients were overweight or obese (body mass index [BMI] >25 kg/m2). Other somatic comorbidities were rare. Interest toward reconstructive genital surgery was more common among male-to-female than female-to-male patients (80% vs. 22%, respectively, p<0.001). Depression (29%) and anxiety (19%) were common psychiatric comorbidities. Parental divorce rate (57%) was higher than in the general adolescent population in Finland (23%, p<0.001). Conclusion: Finnish adolescents diagnosed with GD-seeking GAHT have good somatic health, but a higher proportion of overweight, depression, and anxiety than the general adolescent population. Prospective follow-up of this cohort will provide an opportunity to evaluate the somatic and psychosocial outcomes and quality of life during GAHT.  © 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2022.","adolescents; gender dysphoria; gender identity; gender-affirming hormonal treatment; transgender gynecology","alanine aminotransferase; androstenedione; antidepressant agent; cholesterol; estradiol; follitropin; glucose; hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; luteinizing hormone; prasterone sulfate; prolactin; testosterone; triacylglycerol; adolescent; alanine aminotransferase blood level; androstenedione blood level; anxiety; Article; asthma; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; autism; body mass; cholesterol blood level; cohort analysis; comorbidity; demographics; depression; diastolic blood pressure; divorce; eating disorder; estradiol blood level; female; Finland; Finn (citizen); follitropin blood level; follow up; gender affirming hormonal treatment; gender dysphoria; glucose blood level; hematocrit; hemoglobin blood level; hormonal therapy; human; luteinizing hormone blood level; major clinical study; male; migraine; obesity; prolactin blood level; psychosis; retrospective study; school health service; sex ratio; social psychology; systolic blood pressure; testosterone blood level; triacylglycerol blood level; university hospital","","alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; androstenedione, 26264-53-9, 63-05-8; cholesterol, 57-88-5; estradiol, 50-28-2; follitropin, 9002-68-0; glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3, 8027-56-3; hemoglobin, 9008-02-0; hemoglobin A1c, 62572-11-6; luteinizing hormone, 39341-83-8, 9002-67-9; prasterone sulfate, 651-48-9; prolactin, 12585-34-1, 50647-00-2, 9002-62-4; testosterone, 58-22-0","","","Finnish Society of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology; Jane ja Aatos Erkon Säätiö, J&AE","This work was supported by The Finnish Society of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (N.V.) and Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation (H.S.-P.).

Longitudinal tracking of this cohort will allow investigation of the relationships between multiple outcome domains across the course of care. Subsets of Optymise have completed detailed neuropsychological and neurobiological assessments, permitting investigation of associations between these measures and longitudinal course. Participants Young people (aged 12-30) presenting to clinics coordinated by the BMC were recruited to a research register (n=6743) progressively between June 2008 and July 2018. To date, 2767 individuals have been included in Optymise based on the availability of at least one detailed clinical assessment. Measures Trained researchers use a clinical research proforma to extract key data from clinical files to detail social and occupational functioning, clinical presentation, self-harm and suicidal thoughts and behaviours, alcohol and other substance use, physical health comorbidities, personal and family history of mental illness, and treatment utilisation at the following time points: baseline, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months, and time last seen. Findings to date There is moderate to substantial agreement between raters for data collected via the proforma. While wide variations in individual illness course are clear, social and occupational outcomes suggest that the majority of cohort members show no improvement in functioning over time. Differential rates of longitudinal transition are reported between early and late stages of illness, with a number of baseline factors associated with these transitions. Furthermore, there are longitudinal associations between prior suicide attempts and inferior clinical and functional outcomes. Future plans Future reports will detail the longitudinal course of each outcome domain and examine multidirectional relationships between these domains both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and explore in subsets the associations between detailed neurobiological measures and clinical, social and functional outcomes. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

The present study aims to describe patterns of mental illness and psychoactive substance use in Hijra subjects and study their association with gender experience and psychosocial adversity. Methods: Fifty self-identified Hijras availing HIV-prevention services in New Delhi, India, were interviewed. Data on mental disorders, psychoactive substance use, quality of life, discrimination, empowerment, violence and gender identity were assessed using structured instruments. Results: Subjects were mostly in their mid-twenties, and had joined the Hijra community in their mid-teens. More subjects (46%) were involved in begging than in traditional Hijra roles (38%). Sex work was reported by 28% subjects. The rates of lifetime mental illness was 38%, most commonly alcohol abuse (26%); others had anxiety or depressive disorders (8% each), somatoform disorders (6%) and bulimia nervosa (n = 1). Disempowerment was mostly experienced in domains of autonomy and community participation; 52% had experienced sexual or psychological violence. Discrimination was attributed to gender (100%), appearance (28%) or sexual orientation (28%). There were negative correlations between the physical domain of WHO-QOL and physical violence and depression scores; and between discrimination and WHO-QOL environmental, physical and psychological domains. Conclusions: This Hijra group showed high rates of mental disorder and substance involvement, related to QOL domains and experiences of discrimination and disempowerment. © The Author(s) 2020.","discrimination;

Specific sub-topics examined include 1) dietary intake, 2) nutrition-related health disparities, 3) validity and reliability of nutrition assessment methods, 4) the effects of nutrition interventions/exposures, and 5) hormone therapy. Methods: A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and other databases for peer-reviewed articles published from January 1999 until December 5, 2019 to identify studies addressing the research objective and meeting eligibility criteria. Conference abstracts and registered trials published or registered in the five years prior to the search were also included. Findings were reported in a study characteristics table, a bubble chart and heat maps. Results: The search of the databases identified 5403 studies, including full peer-reviewed studies, systematic reviews, conference abstracts and registered trials. Following title/abstract screening, 189 studies were included in the narrative analysis. Ten studies reported dietary intake in transgender individuals, 64 studies reported nutrition-related health disparities in transgender compared to cisgender individuals, one study examined validity and reliability of nutrition assessment methods, two studies reported nutrition interventions, and 127 studies reported on the intermediate and health effects of hormone therapy. Conclusion: Individuals who are transgender have unique nutrition needs, which may vary according to the stage and type of gender-affirmative therapy that they are undergoing. There is scant research examining effective nutrition therapy methods for nutrition professionals working with transgender individuals.

The present study investigates key associations between experiences that are common in TNB populations and EP. TNB individuals located within the United States (N = 212) who self-identified as currently experiencing disordered eating or an eating disorder were recruited from social media outlets and completed an online survey that included measures of EP, discrimination-based trauma symptoms, internalized transphobia, and gender dysphoria. The average age of participants was just over 27 years old (SD = 6.22) and the majority of participants (68.9%) were nonbinary. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 28 and PROCESS 4.0. Discrimination trauma [β =.27, t(211) = 3.90, p <.001] and internalized transphobia [β =.21, t(211) = 3.03, p =.003] were significant predictors of EP in a multiple regression model. Additionally, internalized transphobia partially mediated the association between discrimination trauma and EP. Findings reinforce the need for trauma-informed and multiculturally competent provision of services for TNB populations presenting with eating concerns. Results also highlight the complex role that previously unexplored variables play in the etiology of EP for TNB populations. Implications and clinical recommendations are discussed. © 2022 Taylor & Francis.","","Adult; Gender Identity; Humans; Surveys and Questionnaires; Transgender Persons; United States; adult; aged; anxiety; Article; attention; behavior; body weight gain; confirmatory factor analysis; cross-sectional study; eating; eating disorder; fear; feedback system; female; gender dysphoria; human; injury; LGBTQIA+ people; major clinical study; male; mental health; multiple regression; questionnaire; social media; social phobia; transgender and gender nonbinary; United States; gender identity; transgender","","","","","","","Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, (2013); Guidelines for psychological practice with transgender and gender nonconforming people, American Psychologist, 70, 9, pp. 832-864, (2015); Austin A., ”There I am”: A grounded theory study of young adults navigating a transgender or gender nonconforming identity within a context of oppression and invisibility, Sex Roles, 75, pp. 215-230, (2016); Barr S.M., Snyder K.E., Adelson J.L., Budge S.L., Posttraumatic stress in the trans community: The role of anti-transgender bias, non-affirmation, and internalized transphobia, Psychology of Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity, (2021); Bell K., Rieger E., Hirsch J.K., Eating disorder symptoms and proneness in gay men, lesbian women, and transgender and gender non-conforming adults: Comparative levels and a proposed mediational model, Frontiers in Psychology, 9, 2692, pp. 1-13, (2019); Bockting W.O., Miner M.H., Swineburne Romine R.E., Dolezal C., Robinson B.B.E., Simon Rosser B.R., Coleman E., The transgender15- identity survey: A measure of internalized transphobia, LGBT Health, 7, 1, pp. 15-27, (2020); Bowman M.K., The lived experience of transgender individuals with eating disorders, College of Science and Health Theses and Dissertations, (2018); Bradford N.J., Catalpa J.M., Social and psychological heterogeneity among binary transgender, non-binary transgender and cisgender individuals, Psychology & Sexuality, 10, 1, pp. 69-82, (2019); Chesney E., Goodwin G.M., Fazel S., Risk of all-cause and suicide mortality in mental disorders: A meta-review, World Psychiatry, 13, 2, pp. 153-160, (2014); Ciao A.C., Loth K., Neumark-Sztainer D., Preventing eating disorder pathology: Common and unique features of successful eating disorders prevention programs, Current Psychiatry Reports, 16, 7, (2014); Claydon E.A., Lilly C.L., Zerwas S.C., Zullig K.J., Davidov D.M., Cottrell L., White M.A., An exploratory study on the intergenerational transmission of dieting proneness within an eating disorder population, Eating and Weight Disorders, 24, 1, pp. 1-11, (2019); Cusack C.E., Cooper M., Libbey N., Galupo M.P., Rumination & eating psychopathology among trans and nonbinary individuals: A path analysis integrating minority stress, Eating Behaviors, 42, pp. 1-7, (2021); Cusack C.E., Iampieri A.O., Galupo M.P., “I’m still not sure if the eating disorder is a result of gender dysphoria”: Trans and nonbinary individuals’ descriptions of their eating and body concerns in relation to their gender, Psychology of Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity, (2022); de Blok C.J.M., Wiepjes C.M., van Velzen D.M., Staphorsius A.S., Nota N.M., Gooren L.J.G., Kreukels B.P.C., den Heijer M., Mortality trends over five decades in adult transgender people receiving hormone treatment: A report from the Amsterdam cohort of gender dysphoria, Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology, 9, 10, pp. 663-670, (2021); The social and economic cost of eating disorders in the United States of America: A report for the strategic training initiative for the prevention of eating disorders and the academy for eating disorders, (2020); Diemer E.W., Grant J.D., Munn-Chernoff M.A., Patterson D.A., Duncan A.E., Gender identity, sexual orientation, and eating-related pathology in a national sample of college students, Journal of Adolescent Health, 57, 2, pp. 144-149, (2015); Fairburn C.G., Beglin S.J., Eating disorder examination questionnaire (EDE-Q) [database record, (1994); Feder S., Isserlin L., Seale E., Hammond N., Norris M.L., Exploring the association between eating disorders and gender dysphoria in youth, Eating Disorders, 25, 4, pp. 310-317, (2017); Guss C.E., Williams D.N., Reisner S.L., Austin S.B., Katz-Wise S.L., Disordered weight management behaviors, nonprescription steroid use, and weight perception in transgender youth, Journal of Adolescent Health, 60, 1, pp. 17-22, (2017); Hartman-Munick S., Silverstein S., Guss C.E., Lopez E., Calzo J.P., Gordon A.R., Eating disorder screening and treatment experiences of transgender and gender diverse young adults, Eating Behaviors, 41, (2021); Hayes A.F., Introduction to mediation, moderation, and conditional process analysis.

However, only a limited number of categories of pathology have been diagnosed in some chimpanzees exclusively by using adapted versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). With this in mind, we have created a questionnaire for the assessment of psychopathologies in 23 rescued ex-performer and ex-pet chimpanzees, based on an inclusion-exclusion adaptation of the fifth edition of the DSM. A total of 70 items were retained for the Chimpanzee Psychopathology Questionnaire in accordance with 3 main criteria: deleting those that could not be applied to the subjects, retaining those that could be applied, and adapted when needed. Principal component analysis and regularized exploratory factor analysis revealed 9 statistically significant factors with acceptable standards of interrater reliability and validity, accounting for 70.78 % of the variance. The factors obtained were clear and similar to some of the main categories of diagnosis for humans. Nevertheless, the limitation of the sample, the subjectivity in the creation of the questionnaire, as well as the theoretical and methodological challenges of the adaptation of the DSM to chimpanzees, led to the fact that this research should be considered as a first contact study on the identification of disorder categories in a group of chimpanzees. The main purpose of this study is to start a debate to promote research on psychopathology in chimpanzees and other animals. Likewise, it is important to emphasize that the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in chimpanzees could be translated to important pragmatic aspects for the species related to awareness, legal implications, welfare, and comparative psychopathology. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","chimpanzees; DSM; mental disorder; primates; psychopathology","addiction; anxiety disorder; Article; bipolar disorder; Chimpanzee Psychopathology Questionnaire; depression; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; disorders of higher cerebral function; dissociative disorder; eating disorder; exploratory factor analysis; female; gender dysphoria; impulse control disorder; interrater reliability; male; medication induced movement disorder; mental disease; mental disease assessment; motor dysfunction; nonhuman; obsessive compulsive disorder; Pan troglodytes; paraphilic disorder; personality disorder; physiological stress; principal component analysis; psychosomatic disorder; psychotrauma; risk factor; schizophrenia; sexual dysfunction; sleep disorder; urinary tract disease; validation study","","","","","Fundaci?n Mona and Loro Parque; Generalitat de Catalunya, (2017-SGR-1040, LCF/PR/PR17/11120020)","Funding text 1: The authors wish to thank Fundació Mona and Loro Parque for their facilities to complete this project and all the raters for helping in the “Chimpanzee Psychopathology Questionnaire” assessment.

Their relatively covert, frequently subtle presentations and diverse etiologies, pose major challenges in diagnosis and treatments. Recent studies have yielded insights that the etiology in the majority are due to environmental and sporadic causes, rather than genetic in origin. Aims: To retrospectively examine the cognitive and behavioral impairments in the veteran population to garner the range of differing syndrome presentations and etiological subcategories with a specific focus on frontotemporal lobe disorders. Methodology: The design is a retrospective, observational registry, case series with the collection of epidemiological, clinical, cognitive, laboratory and radiological data on people with cognitive and behavioral disorders. Inclusion criteria for entry were veterans evaluated exclusively at Orlando VA Healthcare System, neurology section, receiving a diagnosis of FTD by standard criteria, during the observation period dated from July 2016 to March 2021. Frontotemporal disorders (FTD) were delineated into five clinical 5 subtypes. Demographic, cardiovascular risk factors, cognitive, behavioral neurological, neuroimaging data and presumed etiological categories, were collected for those with a diagnosis of frontotemporal disorder. Results: Of the 200 patients with FTD, further cognitive, behavioral neurological evaluation with standardized, metric testing was possible in 105 patients. Analysis of the etiological groups revealed significantly different younger age of the traumatic brain injury (TBI) and Gulf War Illness (GWI) veterans who also had higher Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) scores. The TBI group also had significantly more abnormalities of hypometabolism, noted on the PET brain scans. Behavioral neurological testing was notable for the findings that once a frontotemporal disorder had been diagnosed, the four different etiological groups consistently had abnormal FRSBE scores for the 3 principal frontal presentations of (i) abulia/apathy, (ii) disinhibition, and (iii) executive dysfunction as well as abnormal Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI) scores with no significant difference amongst the etiological groups. The most common sub-syndromes associated with frontotemporal syndromes were the Geschwind-Gastaut syndrome (GGS), Klüver-Bucy syndrome (KBS), involuntary emotional expression disorder (IEED), cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCA), traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES) and prosopagnosia. Comparisons with the three principal frontal lobe syndrome clusters (abulia, disinhibition, executive dysfunction) revealed a significant association with abnormal disinhibition FRSBE T-scores with the GGS. The regression analysis supported the potential contribution of disinhibition behavior that related to this complex, relatively common behavioral syndrome in this series. The less common subsyndromes in particular, were notable, as they constituted the initial overriding, presenting symptoms and syndromes characterized into 16 separate conditions. Conclusion: By deconstructing FTD into the multiple sub-syndromes and differing etiologies, this study may provide foundational insights, enabling a more targeted precision medicine approach for future studies, both in treating the sub-syndromes as well as the underlying etiological process.

Peer support for discharge has been suggested as an approach to reducing readmission post-discharge. Implementation has been called for in policy, however, evidence of effectiveness from large rigorous trials is missing. We aimed to establish whether peer support for discharge reduces readmissions in the year post-discharge. Methods: We report a parallel, two-group, individually randomised, controlled superiority trial, with trial personnel masked to allocation. Patients were adult psychiatric inpatients (age ≥18 years) with at least one previous admission in the preceding 2 years, excluding those who had a diagnosis of any organic mental disorder, or a primary diagnosis of learning disability, an eating disorder, or drug or alcohol dependency, recruited from seven state-funded mental health services in England. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to the intervention (peer support plus care as usual) or control (care as usual) groups by an in-house, online randomisation service, stratified by site and diagnostic group (psychotic disorders, personality disorders, and other eligible non-psychotic disorders) with randomly permuted blocks of randomly varying length to conceal the allocation sequence and achieve the allocation ratio. The peer support group received manual-based, one-to-one peer support, focused on building individual strengths and engaging with activities in the community, beginning during the index admission and continuing for 4 months after discharge, plus care as usual. Care as usual consisted of follow-up by community mental health services within 7 days of discharge. The primary outcome was psychiatric readmission 12 months after discharge (number of patients readmitted at least once), analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. All patients were included in a safety analysis, excluding those who withdrew consent for use of their data. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN10043328. The trial was complete at the time of reporting. Findings: Between Dec 1, 2016, and Feb 8, 2019, 590 patients were recruited and randomly assigned, with 294 allocated to peer support (287 included in the analysis after withdrawals and loss to follow-up), and 296 to care as usual (291 in the analysis). Mean age was 39·7 years (SD 13·7; range 18–75). 306 patients were women, 267 were men, three were transgender, and two preferred not to say. 353 patients were White, 94 were Black, African, Caribbean, or Black British, 68 were Asian or Asian British, 48 were of mixed or multiple ethnic groups, and 13 were of other ethnic groups. In the peer support group, 136 (47%) of 287 patients were readmitted at least once within 12 months of discharge. 146 (50%) of 291 were readmitted in the care as usual group. The adjusted risk ratio of readmission was 0·97 (95% CI 0·82–1·14; p=0·68), and the adjusted odds ratio for readmission was 0·93 (95% CI 0·66–1·30; p=0·68). The unadjusted risk difference was 0·03 (95% CI –0·11 to 0·05; p=0·51) in favour of the peer support group. Serious adverse events were infrequent (67 events) and similar between groups (34 in the peer support group, 33 in the care as usual group). Threat to life (self-harm) was the most common serious adverse event (35 [52%] of 67 serious adverse events). 391 other adverse events were reported, with self-harm (not life threatening) the most common (189 [48%] of 391). Interpretation: One-to-one peer support for discharge from inpatient psychiatric care, plus care as usual, was not superior to care as usual alone in the 12 months after discharge. This definitive, high-quality trial addresses uncertainty in the evidence base and suggests that peer support should not be implemented to reduce readmission post-discharge for patients at risk of readmission. Further research needs to be done to improve engagement with peer support in high-need groups, and to explore differential effects of peer support for people from different ethnic communities.

This study examined health behavior correlates of weight stigma and diabetes stigma in 1,227 adults with type 2 diabetes. Results showed that experiencing weight stigma in health care, experiencing differential treatment from others because of their diabetes, and engaging in self-stigma for diabetes and body weight were each significantly associated with increased frequency of binge eating and eating as a coping strategy to deal with negative feelings. Internalizing weight stigma was also significantly associated with lower levels of physical activity and worse self-rated health. These findings suggest that initiatives to improve the health and well-being of people with type 2 diabetes must consider the potentially harmful roles of weight stigma and diabetes stigma. ©2022 by the American Diabetes Association.","","adult; Article; binge eating disorder; body mass; body weight; coping behavior; diabetes mellitus; distress syndrome; eating; eating disorder; ethnicity; female; health behavior; human; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; physical activity; questionnaire; stigma; transgender; weight stigma; wellbeing","","","","","Rudd Foundation; Deakin University; Diabetes Victoria","This study was supported by the Rudd Foundation.

However, several transgender health guidelines propose an informed consent model of care to respect patient autonomy. This research aimed to understand, characterize, and asses the quality of information gathered through referral letters for patients consulting for gender-affirming surgeries. Methods: A retrospective review of electronic medical records (EMRs), including referral letters from behavioral health (BH) and primary care providers (PCPs), was conducted for patients seeking chest or genital surgery by a single surgeon between 2017 and 2019. Data were abstracted manually and included medical and gender history and documentation of WPATH-recommended surgical criteria. Results: A total of 233 patient records, including 171 PCP letters and 231 BH letters, were reviewed. With respect to documentation of surgical criteria, 92% of BH letters documented a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, 63% ability to provide informed consent, and 51% management of BH comorbidities. More than half of individuals with chronic physical health conditions did not have those conditions documented in their referral letters. Similarly, BH letters often failed to document BH diagnoses endorsed by patients. For example, while 80% of patients endorsed a diagnosis of anxiety, more than half did not have it documented in their letters. Overall, greater than half of diagnoses across BH conditions were only documented as present in the EMR. Conclusion: Referral letters only variably documented WPATH-recommended surgical criteria and did not reliably document physical and mental health comorbidities. Our research suggests that multidisciplinary pre-surgical assessment may be more useful than referral letters in some settings.  © 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2022.","gender-affirming surgery;

Notably, gender minorities are four and six times more likely than their cisgender female and male peers, respectively, to be treated for or diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Despite higher rates of OCD, more psychiatric comorbidities, and minority stressors, little is known about the clinical presentation and treatment outcomes of gender minorities with OCD. Using a sample of 974 patients in specialty treatment programs for OCD, the current study found that gender minorities reported more severe contamination symptoms and greater incidence of comorbid substance use/addiction, trauma/stressor-related, personality, and other/miscellaneous disorders compared to cisgender male and female patients. Despite significantly longer lengths of stay, gender minorities reported less symptom improvement across treatment compared to cisgender male and female patients. Findings underscore the need for continued research to improve the effectiveness and individualization of treatment for gender minorities with OCD. © Copyright 2022 Springer Publishing Company, LLC.","gender minorities;

There is, however, little research on how they compare to adolescents referred due to mental health problems (MHR). We set out to compare psychopathology in adolescents referred to our specialized gender identity unit (n = 84) and adolescents referred to a general adolescent psychiatric clinic (n = 293) in a university hospital setting in Finland. Of the GR adolescents, 40.9% had not received any psychiatric diagnosis during adolescence. Eating disorders were less common in the GR than in the MHR group, but otherwise the prevalences of disorders did not differ statistically significantly. At the symptom level, the GR adolescents displayed significantly more suicidal ideation and talk and less alcohol abuse and eating disorder symptoms than did the MHR adolescents, but otherwise their symptom profiles were comparable. Additionally, the GR adolescents had significantly fewer total externalizing symptoms than did the MHR adolescents. Adolescents seeking gender affirming treatments present with psychiatric symptoms and disorders comparable to those seen among adolescent psychiatric patients. Medical gender affirming care may not be a sufficient intervention for treating psychiatric comorbidities of adolescents with gender dysphoria. © 2022","Adolescence; Externalizing; Family adversities; Gender dysphoria; Internalizing; Psychopathology","Adolescent; Comorbidity; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Gender Dysphoria; Gender Identity; Humans; Male; Psychopathology; adolescent; alcohol abuse; Article; bereavment; checklist; co morbid psychopathology; eating disorder; externalizing disorder; family adversity; family violence; female; Finland; gender affirming treatment; gender dysphoria; human; internalizing disorder; male; medical procedures; mental disease; mental health service; parental divorce or separation; parental severe mental disease; parental severe somatic illness; parental substance use problem; prevalence; psychiatric diagnosis; retrospective study; severe financial difficulies; severe problem related to sibling; sex difference; sexual abuse within the family; social problem; suicidal ideation; comorbidity; eating disorder; gender dysphoria; gender identity; mental disease","","","","","Tays, (9AA022, 9X012)","The study has received financial support from Tampere University Hospital Research Grant (9X012 and 9AA022).","Aitken M., Steensma T.D., Blanchard R., Vanderlaan D.P., Wood H., Fuentes A., Spegg C., Wasserman L., Ames M., Fitzsimmons C.L., Leef J.H., Lishak V., Reim E., Takagi A., Vinik J., Wreford J., Cohen-Kettenis P.T., de Vries A.L., Kreukels B.P., Zucker K.J., Evidence for an altered sex ratio in clinic-referred adolescents with gender dysphoria, J.

Many children do not receive these recommended services, despite the known association between antipsychotic medications and metabolic dysfunction. The main objective of this study was to quantify the association among children's MH diagnosis categories, sociodemographic characteristics and receipt of first-line psychosocial care among children in Florida Medicaid Methods: Florida Medicaid enrollment, healthcare and pharmacy claims were used for this multivariate analysis. Children were assigned to condition clusters wherein related diagnoses were grouped into clinically relevant categories. A total of 7704 children were included in the final analysis. Results: Twenty-four percent of children in Florida Medicaid do not receive first-line, nonpharmacological psychosocial care. Age was significantly associated with not receiving psychosocial services, with older children less likely to receive. Non-Hispanic White children as well as those living in rural areas had lower odds of receiving behavioral intervention prior to initiating antipsychotics. Children with mood-disorders, behavior problems, anxiety and stress related disorders were more likely to receive first-line psychosocial care. Conclusions: This study provides an important understanding of the variability in receipt of first-line psychosocial care before antipsychotic medication initiation among children in Medicaid based on sociodemographic and MH health characteristics. These analyses can be used to develop quality improvement initiatives targeted toward children that are most vulnerable for not receiving recommended care. © 2021 Academic Pediatric Association","antipsychotic use; psychosocial care; race-ethnicity; rurality; social vulnerability","Adolescent; Antipsychotic Agents; Child; Florida; Humans; Medicaid; Mood Disorders; Psychiatric Rehabilitation; United States; neuroleptic agent; neuroleptic agent; adolescent; alcoholism; anxiety disorder; Article; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; autism; bipolar disorder; catatonia; child; child abuse; child neglect; child parent relation; conduct disorder; controlled study; cross-sectional study; delirium; disruptive behavior; eating disorder; ethnicity; face dysmorphia; feces incontinence; female; Florida; gender dysphoria; health care; human; intellectual impairment; kleptomania; major clinical study; major depression; male; medicaid; medical informatics; mental disease; mood disorder; multivariate analysis; opiate addiction; oppositional defiant disorder; personality disorder; pharmacy (shop); physiological stress; posttraumatic stress disorder; prescription; problem behavior; psychosis; psychosocial care; psychosocial disorder; psychosomatic disorder; pyromania; race; rural area; schizoaffective psychosis; schizophrenia; sexual deviation; sexual dysfunction; sleep disorder; social vulnerability; sociodemographics; suicidal ideation; suicide attempt; tic; trichotillomania; urine incontinence; medicaid; mood disorder; psychosocial rehabilitation; United States","","Antipsychotic Agents, ","","","U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS; Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, AHRQ, (U18 HS025298); Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, AHRQ; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS","Funding text 1: This article is published as part of a supplement sponsored by the US Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.; Funding text 2: Financial statement: This study was conducted under a grant from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (grant # U18 HS025298 ).

Method: Participants were 25 TNB individuals and 376 cisgender individuals admitted to a HLOC ED treatment facility. Participants completed the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Beck Anxiety Inventory at admission and discharge. Results: TNB individuals showed significant improvements on EDE-Q global scores between admission and discharge (Cohen's d = 1.27), and showed similar improvements on the EDE-Q over the course of treatment (Cohen's d = 0.06) when compared to cisgender individuals. TNB individuals had more severe depression at admission (Cohen's d = 0.61). Although depression improved over the course of treatment for both groups, TNB individuals showed less improvement (Cohen's d = 0.59). Suicidality was higher for TNB individuals on admission and discharge and did not improve significantly over the course of treatment (Cohen's d = 0.38). Discussion: This study provides preliminary evidence that TNB and cisgender individuals show similar improvement in ED symptoms during HLOC treatment. However, TNB individuals have more severe depression and less improvement in depression compared to cisgender individuals, without improvement in suicidality. TNB individuals may benefit from care targeting depression and suicidality during ED treatment. Public Significance Statement: TNB individuals have increased risk of EDs. Little research addresses how TNB individuals respond to ED treatment, which was traditionally created for cisgender individuals. We present one of the first studies examining ED treatment outcomes for TNB adults. TNB individuals showed improved ED symptoms with treatment, but less improvement in depression and their suicidality remained elevated. This suggests the need for targeted treatment. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","anxiety; depression; eating disorders; nonbinary; suicidality; transgender; treatment outcomes","Adult; Anxiety; Feeding and Eating Disorders;

The aim of this paper was to describe (1) the rationale behind the study and the corresponding selection of constructs to be assessed; (2) the study design and methodology; (3) the resultant sociodemographic characteristics of the full sample; (4) how the baseline survey data compares to the UK adult population (using data from the Census) on a variety of sociodemographic variables; (5) the ongoing efforts for weekly and monthly longitudinal assessments of the baseline cohort; and (6) outline future research directions. We believe the study is in a unique position to make a significant contribution to the growing body of literature to help understand the psychological impact of this pandemic and inform future clinical and research directions that the UK will implement in response to COVID-19. © 2020, The Author(s).","Coronavirus; COVID-19; General population; Longitudinal; Mental health; Psychosocial; Survey; United Kingdom","adult; aged; anxiety disorder; Article; asthma; coronavirus disease 2019; demography; diabetes mellitus; dyspnea; eating disorder; educational status; ethics; ethnicity; female; follow up; generalized anxiety disorder; groups by age; health survey; heart disease; human; information processing; informed consent; injury; loneliness; longitudinal study; major clinical study; major depression; male; malignant neoplasm; marriage; mental health; methodology; obsessive compulsive disorder; pandemic; personal experience; personal income; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychological aspect; psychological well-being; psychosis; quality control; quarantine; religion; risk benefit analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sleep quality; social media; social participation; social phobia; social support; symptom; transgender; United Kingdom","","","","","Queens University Belfast in Northern Ireland","The COVID-19 Psychological Well-being Study was designed as a rapid data collection exercise across the UK population.

Participants included 3,371 adult students from 78 campuses who identified as transgender or nonbinary (TNB) and completed the 2017–2018 or 2018–2019 waves of the cross-sectional multi-institute Healthy Minds Study. Via an online survey, participants completed validated measures assessing perceptual and cognitive-affective body image constructs, positive mental health, and eating disorder pathology. A structural equation model examined whether weight misperception (over and underperception) and thin-ideal overvaluation were associated with positive mental health and, in turn, eating disorder pathology. Whether these associations differed among individuals who identified as trans men, trans women, and genderqueer/gender nonconforming and individuals with self-identified TNB identities was examined via a multiple-group structural equation model. Overall, 35% of participants exhibited elevated eating disorder pathology. Overvaluation of the thin ideal and weight overperception, but not weight underperception, were associated with lower levels of positive mental health, which in turn was associated with elevated eating disorder pathology. These associations did not differ across the assessed TNB identity groups. These findings support the continued use of a positive psychological perspective in research seeking to explain the elevated risk for eating disorder pathology found among individuals with TNB identities. Screening individuals comprising these historically overlooked groups for the presence of weight overperception and thin-ideal overvaluation via brief screening forms during routine health care visits is recommended. © 2022 American Psychological Association","Eating disorders; Gender minorities; Mental health; Positive psychology; Weight misperception","","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (F31MH120982); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH","This work was completed in part with support from the National Institute of Mental Health of the National Institutes of Health under Award F31MH120982 to Kelly A.

Data collection included a review of the notes from his electronic health record and an unstructured, in-depth interview. The researchers analyzed the data through a hybrid biographical and psychological lens using gender schema theory and transgender theory. Five themes were constructed to characterize his relationship with food and exercise: punishment, control, physical transition, health promotion, and self-care. Though transgender individuals may be vulnerable to developing an unhealthy relationship with food and exercise, this heightened focus on the body may be an ideal time to instill healthy dietary and exercise patterns with the support of mental health counselors and registered dietitians. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","creativity in counseling; exercise; Nutrition; transgender","adult; article; case report; clinical article; counseling; counselor; creativity; dietitian; electronic health record; exercise; female; gender; health promotion; human; interview; male; mental health; narrative; nutrition; punishment; self care; transgender","","","","","","","International dietetics and nutrition terminology reference manual, (2012); Avila J.T., Golden N.H., Aye T., Eating disorder screening in transgender youth, Journal of Adolescent Health, 65, 6, pp. 815-817, (2019); Bem S.L., Gender schema theory.

Method: We analyzed data from 2,818 individuals treated at a large, US-based, ED center, 471 (17%) of whom identified as SGM. Objective 1 was tested using logistic regression and Objectives 2 and 3 used mixed-effects models. Results: SGMs had higher prevalence of sexual abuse (OR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.71, 2.58), other trauma (e.g., verbal/physical/emotional abuse; OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.68, 2.54), and bullying (OR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.73, 2.62) histories. SGMs had higher global EDE-Q scores than CHs at admission (γ = 0.42, SE = 0.08, p <.001) but improved faster early in treatment (γ = 0.316, SE = 0.12, p =.008). By discharge, EDE-Q scores did not differ between SGMs and CHs. Discussion: Our main hypothesis of greater abuse histories among SGMs was supported and could be one explanation of their more severe ED symptoms at treatment admission compared to CHs. In addition, elevated symptom severity in SGMs at admission coincides with greater delay between ED onset and treatment initiation among SGMs—possibly a consequence of difficulties with ED recognition in SGMs by healthcare providers. We recommend increased training for providers on identifying EDs in SGMs to reduce barriers to early intervention. © 2020 The Authors.

Objective: To evaluate the association between strabismus and mental illness among children. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study analyzed claims data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse, a longitudinal deidentified commercial insurance claims database, from 12005189 patients enrolled in the health plan between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2017. Eligibility criteria included age younger than 19 years at the time of strabismus diagnosis, enrollment in the health plan between 2007 and 2018, and having at least 1 strabismus claim based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Controls were children in the same database with no eye disease codes other than refractive error reported. Demographic characteristics and mental illness claims were compared. Statistical analysis was conducted from December 1, 2018, to July 31, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: Presence of mental illness claims. Results: Among the 12005189 patients (6095523 boys [50.8%]; mean [SD] age, 8.0 [5.9] years) in the study, adjusted odds ratios for the association of mental illnesses with strabismus were 2.01 (95% CI, 1.99-2.04) for anxiety disorder, 1.83 (95% CI, 1.76-1.90) for schizophrenia, 1.64 (95% CI, 1.59-1.70) for bipolar disorder, 1.61 (95% CI, 1.59-1.63) for depressive disorder, and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.97-1.02) for substance use disorder. There was a moderate association between each strabismus type (esotropia, exotropia, and hypertropia) and anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depressive disorder; odds ratios ranged from 1.23 (95% CI, 1.17-1.29) for the association between esotropia and bipolar disorder to 2.70 (95% CI, 2.66-2.74) for the association between exotropia and anxiety disorder. Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study suggests that there was a moderate association between strabismus and anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depressive disorder but not substance use disorder. Recognizing that these associations exist should encourage mental illness screening and treatment for patients with strabismus. 2022 American Medical Association.

The relatively sudden, global emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic served as a massive stressor to virtually all people, regardless of infection status. This study hypothesized that actual and perceived stressors from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, in the categories of recurring disruptions, environmental threat, and social isolation would be positively associated with increased self-reported eating in the United States. Methods: Over 1100 English-fluent adults (52.8% women) living in the United States were recruited for a cross-sectional online survey about eating, COVID-19 consequences, and stress experiences. Linear regressions examined associations between perceived stress on five eating measures, and individual differences in personal/work situations, perceptions, and adverse experiences during the pandemic. Results: Anxiety, worry, and stress over, rather than direct consequences of, COVID-19 were most consistently associated with self-reported increased eating. Largely, these fell into the stressor categories of environmental threat and social isolation, not recurring disruptions. Body mass index and current self-reported eating pathology symptoms were also consistently associated with these outcomes. Conclusions: These correlational findings suggest specific stressors have pronounced influences on eating behavior of US adults. Remotely deliverable stress mitigation strategies should be explored to attenuate increased eating. © 2021 The Authors.

Decades of research and meta-analytic findings have supported the notion that client expectations about what will happen over the course of therapy and how beneficial therapy will be are directly related to treatment factors, such as the working alliance and treatment outcome. Client expectations can be categorized into two broad categories, outcome expectations (i.e., how beneficial treatment will be) and treatment expectations (i.e., what will happen in treatment). This study sought to examine clients’ treatment expectations, specifically, their role expectations, which represent their beliefs of how their therapists will act in session. Data for this study included 1,233 clients participating in individual counseling with 49 therapists at a university counseling center. Multilevel polynomial regression and response surface analysis were used to test congruent and discrepant effects of clients’ pretreatment support and challenge expectancy on reductions in their psychological distress over the course of treatment. Results indicated that reductions in clients’ psychological distress were the greatest when their support and challenge expectancy scores were congruent and high. In other words, clients who expected both high challenge and high support from their therapist, prior to the start of counseling, reported the greatest improvement in counseling. Clients similarly reported reductions in their psychological distress when their support and challenge expectations were congruent and low, although this effect was smaller than when they expected high levels of both support and challenge. Together, these findings suggest that when clients’ expectations of support and challenge are similar, they fare better in treatment, as opposed to when they expect a greater amount of support than challenge or vice versa. © 2022 American Psychological Association","Challenge; Response surface analysis; Role expectations; Support; Treatment expectations","Counseling; Humans; Motivation; Professional-Patient Relations; Psychotherapy; Treatment Outcome; anorexia nervosa; anxiety; Article; Beck Depression Inventory; behavior; binge eating disorder; burnout; counseling; depression; distress syndrome; expectancy; expectation; homosexual female; human; insulin treatment; mental stress; outcome assessment; polynomial regression analysis; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychotherapy; sexual orientation; social psychology; surface analysis; task performance; transgender; treatment outcome; motivation; procedures; professional-patient relationship","","","","","","","Al-Darmaki F., Kivlighan D.

Preventing and identifying PSM requires an understanding of risk factors and correlates, but large-scale surveys regarding this issue have been lacking. We present the largest multiinstitution study to date on the correlates of PSM among US college students. Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of the 2017 American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment (ACHA-NCHA), an annual national survey on the demographics, health, and academic experiences of US college students. Logistic regression models examined associations between past-year PSM in 40,645 undergraduate college students and hypothesized risk factors. Results: PSM was reported in 8% of college students. PSM was associated with past-year diagnosis or treatment of depression (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.16; 99% CI, 1.01-1.33), anorexia (AOR = 1.44; 99% CI, 1.02-2.03), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AOR = 1.66; 99% CI, 1.41-1.95), and substance use disorder/other addiction (AOR = 1.79; 99% CI, 1.30-2.46). The odds of PSM were 5.5 times higher for students who endorsed past-month use of ""Legal drugs""and 8 times higher for students who endorsed past-month use of ""Illegal drugs""than for those who did not. Other factors associated with PSM included academic difficulty, daytime sleepiness, fraternity or sorority involvement, White race, and cis-male gender. Conclusions: This study identifies many potential risk factors for PSM among US undergraduate college students. Targeted outreach, prevention, and clinical management are discussed. As the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated psychiatric distress, sleep difficulties, substance use, and attentional challenges among college students, this study may serve as a baseline for future studies examining the impact of COVID-19 on PSM among college students.  © 2022 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.","","Central Nervous System Stimulants; COVID-19; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Prescription Drug Misuse; Prescriptions; Prevalence; Students; Substance-Related Disorders; United States; Universities; central stimulant agent; illicit drug; adult; Article; body mass; Caucasian; college student; coronavirus disease 2019; daytime somnolence; demographics; female; female to male transgender; health care access; health disparity; health survey; human; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; mental disease; mental health; pandemic; prescription; prevalence; psychiatrist; psychotherapy; questionnaire; risk factor; secondary analysis; sexual orientation; sleep disorder; sleep quality; substance use; United States; drug dependence; prescription; prescription drug misuse; prevalence; psychology; student; university","","Central Nervous System Stimulants, ","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (K23MH107714)","Submitted: February 7, 2022; accepted August 30, 2022.

To help fill this gap, we investigated whether cumulative exposure to state-level structural sexism from childhood through young adulthood potentiates differences in disordered eating risk between cisgender girls/women and boys/men. Methods: Participants came from the Growing Up Today Study (N = 16,875), a cohort of children aged 9–14 years in 1996 who we followed through 2016. Using a composite index of relevant state policies and social inequalities from the Institute for Women's Policy Research, we categorized states as having high or low levels of structural sexism and summed the number of years participants had lived in a high structural sexism state during the study period to quantify their cumulative exposure. We fit sequential conditional mean models to estimate the effect of cumulative exposure on risk of four outcomes (chronic dieting, purging, binge eating, and overeating), controlling for individual- and state-level confounders via propensity scores. We then tested whether effects differed between girls/women and boys/men by including cumulative-exposure-by-gender-identity interaction terms and calculating the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI). Results: In the full sample, each additional year of living in a high structural sexism state was associated with a 5% increased risk of purging (95% confidence interval (CI): 3%, 7%), an 8% increased risk of binge eating (95% CI: 6%, 10%), and a 9% increased risk of overeating (95% CI: 8%, 11%). Risk increases were larger on average for girls/women than for boys/men, and girls/women who had lived in a high structural sexism state for four or more years had excess risk of chronic dieting (RERI: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.18, 1.10), purging (RERI: 2.64, 95% CI: 1.24, 4.30), and binge eating (RERI: 2.21, 95% CI: 0.93, 3.50). Conclusions: Structural sexism may contribute to inequities in disordered eating between cisgender girls/women and boys/men. Future research should include transgender and gender diverse participants, explore intersectional effects, and identify underlying mechanisms to inform policy-oriented interventions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Cumulative disadvantage; Disordered eating; Epidemiology; Gender; Life-course; Longitudinal; Structural sexism; USA","Adult; Bulimia; Child; Cohort Studies; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Humans; Male; Prospective Studies; Sexism; Young Adult; United States; cohort analysis; epidemiology; equity; gender discrimination; gender relations; policy approach; womens status; adolescent; Article; binge eating disorder; child; chronic dieting; cohort analysis; eating disorder; female; gender identity; human; male; overnutrition; prevalence; propensity score; prospective study; purging disorder; sex ratio; sexism; social inequality; structural sexism; United States; adult; bulimia; eating disorder; sexism; young adult","","","","","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI, (U01HL145386); National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI","","Austin S.B., Nelson L.A., Birkett M.A., Calzo J.P., Everett B., Eating disorder symptoms and obesity at the intersections of gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation in US high school students, Am.

The purpose of this study is to explore perceptions of and experiences with ED treatment during the first year of the pandemic among individuals with past and self-reported EDs in the United States. Methods: Online surveys were administered to adults (N = 510) with a past or current self-reported ED at 13 timepoints between April 2020 and May 2021. Using longitudinal qualitative analysis, 5651 free-text responses were examined to capture experiences with ED treatment and generate inferences of change over time. Results: We categorized results into four sequential, temporal quarters and identified patterns that explained participants' perceptions of facilitators, barriers, and experiences with ED treatment over time: Quarter 1. Treatment Disruption and Reorienting Recovery; Quarter 2. Accumulating COVID-19 Stress and Virtual Treatment Woes; Quarter 3. A Continuation of Inadequate Care; and Quarter 4. Ongoing Adaptation and Adjustment to Uncertainty. Participant experiences were marked by numerous barriers to accessing care, challenges adjusting to virtual treatment, unmet treatment needs, and beginning acceptance of telehealth. Discussion: Our findings present a timeline to help evaluate challenges related to navigating the switch to virtual care which created significant disruption to ED recovery. Participants spent much of the first year trying to adjust to unemployment, loss of insurance, and lack of access to in-person treatment. Future research should identify additional strategies to improve the receipt and experience of care for EDs. Public Significance: Our findings suggest that individuals with eating disorders were significantly challenged by accumulating COVID-19 stress, worsening symptomatology, and limited access to effective treatment during the first year of the pandemic. This knowledge can guide clinicians, treatment centers, and policy makers in addressing the behavioral health needs of individuals impacted by disordered eating amidst emergent public health crises. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","COVID-19; eating disorder treatment; eating disorders; recovery","Adult; COVID-19; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Humans; Pandemics; Self Report; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States; adult; anorexia nervosa; Article; binge eating disorder; bulimia; coronavirus disease 2019; data analysis; eating disorder; ethical dilemma; female; gender identity; health insurance; human; human experiment; longitudinal study; male; pandemic; perception; physiological stress; purging disorder; qualitative analysis; quarantine; self report; social distancing; social media; telecare; telehealth; transgender and gender nonbinary; United States; eating disorder; questionnaire","","","","","Equip Health Inc.; National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (R01MH118278, R01MH119084, R01MH120170, R01MH124871); National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, SAMHSA, (H79 SM081924); Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, SAMHSA; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK, (K23DK129832); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK; Health Resources and Services Administration, HRSA, (1‐D40‐HP45688); Health Resources and Services Administration, HRSA; Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, AHRQ; Brain and Behavior Research Foundation, BBRF; Lundbeckfonden, (R276‐2018‐4581); Lundbeckfonden; Vetenskapsrådet, VR, (538‐2013‐8864); Vetenskapsrådet, VR","Funding text 1: CM Peat reports: Equip Health (Clinical Advisory Board), CM Bulik reports: Shire (grant recipient, Scientific Advisory Board member); Lundbeckfonden (grant recipient); Pearson (author, royalty recipient); Equip Health Inc.

Methods: We compared 64 individuals who self-identified as transgender and presented for SUD treatment to samples of cisgender men and women (separately) matched based on propensity scores which were created based on sociodemographic factors known to influence both the nature of substance use and patterns of treatment engagement including age, education, race, stable housing, and employment status. Comparisons were made using χ2 tests and t-tests in over 150 variables collected at treatment intake regarding physical and mental health, substance use patterns, events that led to treatment, reasons for seeking treatment, and treatment outcomes. Results: The transgender sample endorsed six of the seven suicide-related items more often than at least one of the cisgender-matched samples. Furthermore, the transgender sample remained in treatment significantly longer (M = 32.3, SD = 22.2) than the cisgender male sample (M = 19.5, SD = 26.1, t = 2.17, p = 0.03). Discussion: This study is a first step into understanding gender minority population experiences during SUD treatment. While there was no significant difference between the cisgender and transgender samples on most variables, there was an elevated prevalence of suicidal ideation and behaviors in the transgender sample, which warrants further investigation.

However, discussions of sexual minority populations are often focused on aspects of mental health associated with sexual orientation, with relatively less emphasis placed on transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals’ mental health. No prior studies have compared psychiatric diagnoses between TGD and cisgender patients presenting for psychiatric treatment in a systematic way using semistructured diagnostic interviews assessing a broad range of disorders. Methods: Between April 2014 and January 2021, we administered semistructured diagnostic interviews for DSM-IV disorders to 2,212 psychiatric patients, 69 of whom reported TGD identity (ie, gender identity other than cisgender such as transgender, genderqueer, or nonbinary identity). The patients completed a demographic questionnaire on which they indicated their assigned sex at birth and their current gender identity. Results: TGD patients had on average more diagnoses than cisgender patients (3.54 ± 1.88 vs 3.04 ± 1.72, t= 2.37, P= .02). After controlling for age, TGD patients were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder and borderline personality disorder than cisgender patients (P< .05). Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of psychiatric patients using semistructured diagnostic interviews to compare the frequency of psychiatric disorders between cisgender and TGD patients. These results bear implications for creating gender-inclusive treatment facilities. Psychiatry programs interested in qualifying as Safe Zones and treating TGD patients should have or develop expertise in treating posttraumatic stress disorder and borderline personality disorder. © 2022 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.","","Female;

Participants who self-identified as transgender and gender diverse (N = 71) completed self-report measures of demographics, gender-related experiences, and disordered eating/body image. Analyses comprised evaluation of EDE-QS internal consistency, convergent validity, and specificity for disordered eating. The EDE-QS demonstrated strong internal consistency in the full sample, in participants with and without suspected eating disorders, and in each gender identity group; and correlated significantly with indices of disordered eating and body image. The full scale and each item significantly differentiated between participants with and without suspected eating disorders. This study provides initial evidence for good measurement and construct validity of the EDE-QS as applied to transgender and gender diverse individuals. Findings offer the EDE-QS as a promising, brief tool for screening and/or population-based research related to disordered eating in this high-risk, yet underserved population.

Methods: From the 2018 IBM® MarketScan® Commercial Database, there were 10,415 people identifiable as transgender based on International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) codes and procedure codes, specific to gender-affirming care, from inpatient and outpatient claims. Eating disorders were identified from ICD-10 codes and included anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, eating disorder not otherwise specified, avoidant restrictive feeding and intake disorder, and other specified feeding and eating disorders. We estimated the prevalence of specific eating disorders diagnoses by selecting patient characteristics. Results: Of individuals receiving some form of gender-affirming care, 2.43% (95% confidence interval: 2.14%–2.74%) were diagnosed with an eating disorder: 0.84% anorexia nervosa, 0.36% bulimia nervosa, 0.36% binge eating disorder, 0.15% avoidant restrictive feeding and intake disorder, 0.41% other specified feeding and eating disorders, and 1.37% with an unspecified eating disorder. Among transgender-identifiable patients aged 12–15 years, 5.60% had an eating disorder diagnosis, whereas 0.52% had an eating disorder diagnosis in patients aged 45–64 years. Discussion: In patients identifiable as transgender, with receipt of gender-affirming care, the prevalence of diagnosed eating disorders was low compared to extant self-reported data for eating disorder diagnosis in transgender individuals. Among this population, eating disorders were highest in adolescents and young adults. Clinically verified prevalence estimates for eating disorder diagnosis in transgender people with a history of gender-affirming care warrant further investigation. Public Significance: The present study aims to provide clinically validated, contemporary prevalence estimates for diagnosed eating disorders among a medically affirmed population of transgender adults and children in the United States. We report low prevalence of having any eating disorder relative to prevalence estimates reported in prior literature without clinical validation. These findings may be explained by access to affirming care and medical care generally. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","disordered eating; eating disorders; gender identity; healthcare claims; TGNC; transgender","Adolescent; Anorexia Nervosa; Binge-Eating Disorder; Bulimia Nervosa; Child; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Humans; Insurance; Prevalence; Transgender Persons; United States; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; anorexia nervosa; Article; avoidant restrictive food intake disorder; binge eating disorder; bulimia; child; controlled study; demographics; disease classification; eating disorder; female; health care access; hospital patient; human; ICD-10; insurance; major clinical study; male; medical care; middle aged; outpatient care; patient care; patient identification; patient selection; population structure; prevalence; school child; transgender; United States; validation study; anorexia nervosa; binge eating disorder; bulimia; prevalence; transgender; young adult","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS, (TL1TR001454)","Ms. Ferrucci is a recipient of a pre-doctoral slot on an institutional NIH training grant (TL1TR001454 to Dr. Lapane).

However, knowledge gaps remain regarding the frequency and characterization of foods and calories consumed during cheat meals, and their associations with eating disorder behaviors and psychopathology. Thus, the aims of this study were to delineate engagement in cheat meals among a large, national sample of Canadian adolescents and young adults. Methods: Participants (N = 2,717) were from the Canadian Study of Adolescent Health Behaviors. Frequencies of engagement in cheat meals, and associated foods and calories consumed, in the past 12 months and 30 days were determined. The associations between engagement in cheat meals and eating disorder behaviors and psychopathology were determined using modified Poisson regression analyses. Results: Engagement in cheat meals in the past 12 months was highest among men (60.9%) compared to women (53.7%) and transgender/gender non-conforming (TGNC; 52.5%) participants. Cheat meals consisting between 1,000 and 1,499 cal were those most frequently reported among all participants. Mean number of cheat meals in the past 12 months was equivalent to > 1 per week, which was similar to engagement in the past 30 days. Finally, engagement in cheat meals in the past 12 months and 30 days was associated with patterns of eating disorder behaviors and psychopathology among all participants, including binge-eating-related behaviors. Conclusions: This study further characterized and extended knowledge of cheat meal engagement across genders, aligning with prior research by demonstrating that engagement is associated with greater eating disorder psychopathology. Plain english summary: Findings from this study add to the growing characterization of the novel behavioral phenomenon of cheat meals. Specifically, over half of adolescents and young adults across all 13 provinces and territories in Canada reported engaging in > 1 cal dense cheat meal per week, over the past 12 months. Despite the normalization and promotion of cheat meal engagement among the general public and unique fitness communities, engagement in this behavior is linked to greater eating disorder behaviors and psychopathology, including binge-eating episodes.

To date, however, little is known about the sociodemographic profile and health of transgender military personnel. Methods: U.S. Military personnel who self-identified as transgender completed anonymous online measures of demographics and military service. Participants also completed measures of health, mood, eating pathology, and risk behaviors. Results: One hundred ninety-five service members (mean age: 28.9±7.2 years, 48.7% transmale, 70.3% non-Hispanic White, 7.83±5.9 years in service) completed the survey. The majority of respondents first identified as transgender before military accession. Most had disclosed their gender identity to their command and providers, and had undertaken steps toward gender affirmation. The sample as a whole reported above average physical health, with mood symptoms within normal ranges and few reported risk behaviors. Analyses of covariance indicated that transmales reported significantly better mental health and psychosocial functioning compared with transfemales. Conclusion: In light of current policy that precludes, with limited exceptions, transgender individuals from serving in the U.S. Military in their affirmed gender, the current study provides an initial sociodemographic profile of this understudied population and indicates that transgender service members report above average physical health and few risk behaviors. Preliminary analyses indicated that transfemales in the military may be at higher risk for mental health concerns, compared with transmales. Additional research is needed to elucidate risk and protective factors among transgender service members. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.","active duty; gender dysphoria; military; transgender","adult; alcohol consumption; anxiety; army; Article; body dissatisfaction; body mass; depression; Depression Anxiety Stress Scale; descriptive research; drug use; eating disorder; Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire; female; female to male transgender; gender dysphoria; gender identity; health behavior; high risk behavior; hormonal therapy; human; major clinical study; male; male to female transgender; mental health; military personnel; military service; physical performance; priority journal; self report; sexual and gender minority; Short Form 36; social psychology; stress; transgender; United States","","","","","American Psychological Foundation, APF","This study was funded by an American Psychological Foundation Visionary Grant (awarded to N.A.S.).

The majority of research on the condition has been conducted in cisgender men with a paucity of literature on gender minority people, a population that is at risk for muscle dysmorphia. One of the most widely used measures of muscle dysmorphia symptoms, the Muscle Dysmorphic Disorder Inventory (MDDI), has not been psychometrically validated for use in gender minority samples, the aim of the present study. Methods: We evaluated the psychometric properties of the MDDI in a sample of 1031 gender-expansive individuals (gender minority people whose gender identity differs from that assumed for their sex assigned at birth and is not exclusively binary man or woman) aged 18–74 who were part of The PRIDE Study, a large-scale, U.S., longitudinal cohort study. Results: Using a two-step, split-sample exploratory and confirmatory factor analytic approach, we found support for the original three-factor structure of the measure. The subscales showed adequate internal consistency, and convergent validity was supported based on significant associations of the MDDI subscale scores with theoretically related scores on a widely used measure of disordered eating. Conclusions: These findings provided novel support for adequate psychometric properties of the MDDI in a sample of gender-expansive individuals, facilitating the use of this measure in future research on muscle dysmorphia in this understudied and at-risk population. © 2022, The Author(s).","Gender-expansive; Genderqueer; MDDI; Muscle dysmorphia; Non-binary; Transgender persons","","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (K08HL159350); National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA, (K23DA039800); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK, (K12DK111028); American Heart Association, AHA, (CDA34760281, K23 MH115184)","JMN is supported by the National Institutes of Health (K08HL159350) and the American Heart Association (CDA34760281).

Objective: The primary objective of this study was to describe the proportion of food insecurity and eating disorder behaviors in a volunteer sample of LGBTQ+ individuals aged 18 to 35 years. Design: This study was a cross-sectional analysis of questionnaire data collected from 253 participants between March 2018 and March 2019. Participants and setting: To be included in the study, participants had to be aged 18 to 35 years and identify as being LGBTQ+. Main outcome measures: Food security score, Eating Attitudes Test score, Eating Disorder Examination Self-Report Questionnaire score, anxiety score (Beck), and depressive symptoms score. Statistical analyses performed: The χ2 test was used to analyze the categorical outcomes. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare continuous variables across gender identity groups. All P values < 0.05 were taken as statistically significant. Results: The proportion of participants identifying as a woman, trans male, gender nonconforming, and a man were 39%, 24%, 24%, and 13%, respectively. Food insecurity was reported by 54.4% of respondents with trans males reporting the highest proportions (64.8%). High levels of depressive symptoms were reported by 68.2% of men, 89.8% of women, 91.4% of trans males, and 95.5% of gender-nonconforming respondents (P = 0.009). High anxiety was reported by 20.5%. Eating Disorder Examination Self-Report Questionnaire scores were significantly higher (P < 0.001) compared with a community-based sample. The eating disorder behavior most frequently reported by respondents was binge eating. Only 4.3% reported having sought treatment for an eating disorder. Conclusions: Members of the LGBTQ+ community are at greater risk for food insecurity, eating disorders, and depression, particularly those who identify as trans males. These findings denote the need to focus future research efforts on effective prevention and treatment strategies that are specific to sexual and gender identity groups within the LGBTQ+ community. © 2021 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics","Anxiety; Diet; Feeding and eating disorders; Food supply; Sexual and gender minorities","Adolescent; Adult; Depression; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Feeding Behavior; Female; Food Insecurity; Humans; Male; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; depression; eating disorder; feeding behavior; female; food insecurity; human; male; psychology; questionnaire; sexual and gender minority; young adult","","","","","Shaynee Roper; University of North Florida Office of Undergraduate Research","Funding text 1: The authors thank Shaynee Roper, MEd, for her contribution on scoring the study questionnaires and identification of key publications cited in this manuscript.

Study design: All youth with a diagnosis of DSD (n = 1216) or CAH (n = 1647) and at least 1 outpatient encounter were extracted from the PEDSnet database and propensity-score matched on 8 variables (1:4) with controls (n = 4864 and 6588, respectively) using multivariable logistic regression. The likelihood of having behavioral health diagnoses was examined using generalized estimating equations. Results: Youth with DSD had higher odds of a behavioral health diagnosis (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.4-2.1; P <.0001) and neurodevelopmental diagnosis (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.4, 2.0; P <.0001) compared with matched controls. Youth with CAH did not have an increased odds of a behavioral health diagnosis (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.9, 1.1; P =.9) compared with matched controls but did have higher odds of developmental delay (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.4, 2.4; P <.0001). Conclusions: Youth with DSD diagnosis have higher odds of a behavioral health or neurodevelopmental diagnosis compared with matched controls. Youth with CAH have higher odds of developmental delay, highlighting the need for screening in both groups. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","anxiety; congenital adrenal hyperplasia; depression; developmental delay; difference of sex development; disorder of sex development; intellectual disability; neurodevelopmental; psychiatric","Adolescent; Adrenal Hyperplasia, Congenital; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child Behavior Disorders; Child, Preschool; Databases, Factual; Developmental Disabilities; Disorders of Sex Development; Electronic Health Records; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Logistic Models; Male; Mental Disorders; Neurodevelopmental Disorders; Odds Ratio; Propensity Score; Risk Factors; adjustment disorder; adult; anxiety; anxiety disorder; Article; attention deficit disorder; autism; automutilation; behavior disorder; bipolar disorder; clinical outcome; conduct disorder; congenital adrenal hyperplasia; controlled study; depression; developmental delay; disorder of sex development; eating disorder; female; gender dysphoria; health behavior; human; intellectual impairment; juvenile; language disability; learning disorder; major clinical study; male; mood disorder; outpatient; psychiatric diagnosis; tic; adolescent; behavior disorder; case control study; child; complication; congenital adrenal hyperplasia; developmental disorder; disorder of sex development; electronic health record; factual database; infant; mental disease; newborn; odds ratio; preschool child; propensity score; psychology; risk factor; statistical model","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Cancer Institute, NCI, (K08CA248704); National Cancer Institute, NCI; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (K23HD092588); National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD; Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, DDCF; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (K12HD057022, R03HD102773); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","Supported in part by NIH/Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development K23HD092588 and R03HD102773 (to S.D.), NIH/Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development K12HD057022 (to N.N.), NIH/NCI K08CA248704 (to L.P.), and the Doris Duke Foundation (to S.D. and N.N.).

Yet trans and nonbinary individuals (TNB) may be at greater risk than cisgender individuals to suffer from eating disorders, disordered eating, and body image concerns. The current study takes a phenomenological approach to explore how TNB individuals conceptualize eating and/or body image issues. Qualitative data were obtained from 82 TNB participants who self-reported eating and/or body image concerns. Primary analyses focused on participants’ responses to an open-ended prompt regarding how participants understand the relationships among gender identity, gender expression, and weight and shape control behaviors. Thematic analysis identified five themes: (a) gender dysphoria, (b) puberty, (c) emotion (dys)regulation, (d) gender expression, and (e) recovery/transition. Results indicate various factors salient to gender identity and expression and eating concerns. Findings extend beyond the traditional focus on gender dysphoria by highlighting other important factors for TNB individuals, such as the function ED psychopathology serves (e.g., gender avoidance and self-punishment). This broadens the ED field’s understanding of how gender dysphoria relates to ED psychopathology, rather than focusing solely on the physical body. Distress and associated behaviors related to both gender dysphoria and eating disorder psychopathology may be reciprocal and reinforcing and, as such, should be considered in tandem in treating TNB clients experiencing EDs and body image concerns. This work may better identify ED risk and maintenance within this population and thus optimize prevention and intervention. © 2022 American Psychological Association","Body image; Eating disorders; Nonbinary; Qualitative methods; Transgender","","","","","","","","Algars M., Alanko K., Santtila P., Sandnabba N.

Established predictors of binge eating behavior include negative emotions and sociocultural processes; however, these studies are generally conducted in samples of young women where sexual identity is not known or reported. There is a dearth of research evaluating how sexual minority-specific factors (eg, minority stress and connectedness to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer community) may affect binge eating in sexual minority women. In addition, no studies have examined these processes in racially diverse samples or considered how intersecting minority identities (eg, Black and sexual minority) may affect eating behaviors. Objective: The Health and Experiences in Real Life (HER Life) Project aims to clarify real-world predictors of binge eating in young heterosexual and sexual minority women using ecological momentary assessment. The role of affective, social, and health behavior factors in binge eating will be examined for all women (aim 1), and sexual minority-specific predictors will also be considered for sexual minority women participants (aim 2). Person-level moderators of race, body- and eating-related factors, and sexual minority-specific factors will also be examined to better understand how real-world binge eating predictors may differ for various demographic groups (aim 3). Methods: Researchers aim to recruit 150 sexual minority and 150 heterosexual women from across the United States, including at least 50 Black women for each group, using web-based recruitment methods. The eligibility criteria include identifying as a woman, being aged between 18 and 30 years, and having had at least two binge eating episodes in the last 2 weeks. Participants must endorse being only or mostly attracted to men (considered heterosexual) or only or mostly attracted to women or having a current or most recent female partner (considered sexual minority). Eligible participants complete an initial web-based baseline survey and then 14 days of ecological momentary assessment involving the completion of a morning and before-bed survey and 5 prompted surveys per day as well as a user-initiated survey after binge eating episodes. The data will be analyzed using a series of multilevel models. Results: Data collection started in February 2021. We have currently enrolled 129 sexual minority women and 146 heterosexual women. Data collection is expected to conclude in fall 2022. Conclusions: The Health and Experiences in Real Life Project aims to elucidate potential differences between sexual minority and heterosexual women in within-person factors predicting binge eating and inform eating disorder interventions for sexual minority women. The challenges in recruiting sexual minority women, including the determination of eligibility criteria and considerations for remote data collection, are discussed.  © 2022 Kristin E Heron.","binge eating; ecological momentary assessment; mobile phone; negative affective states; sexual minority stress; sexual minority women","","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01MD012598); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, NIAAA, (K01AA023849); National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, NIAAA; National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, NIMHD","The research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities of the National Institutes of Health under award R01MD012598 to KEH.

Additionally, TGAs experience unique body- and gender-related concerns. The purpose of this study is to explore the nuances of gender identity, gender transitioning, body image, and disordered eating among TGAs. Case summaries and a synthesis of key themes are presented from interviews with nine TGAs aged 16–20 (Mage = 17). All participants reported engaging in at least one behavior to change their weight or shape. Consistent with a theoretical biopsychosociocultural model we proposed, TGAs described body dissatisfaction and disordered eating related to transgender-specific factors (e.g., behaviors aimed at minimizing secondary sex characteristics) and broader developmental and sociocultural factors. Some participants reported improvements in body image and disordered eating following gender transition. The interviews highlight complex associations among gender identity, gender transitioning, body image, and disordered eating during adolescence, suggesting that disentangling transgender-specific factors from other individual factors is difficult. These findings may guide future research on the prevalence and functions of disordered eating among TGAs and point to a unique set of needs for effective detection and treatment of concurrent gender incongruence, body dissatisfaction, and disordered eating. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Adolescence; Body image; Disordered eating; Gender minority; Qualitative; Transgender","Adolescent; Body Dissatisfaction; Body Image; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Gender Identity; Humans; Male; Qualitative Research; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Transgender Persons; Young Adult; adolescent; body image; eating disorder; female; gender identity; human; male; psychology; qualitative research; sexual and gender minority; transgender; young adult","","","","","University of Pittsburgh Central Research Development Fund; National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (K01 MH117142, T32 MH018269, T32 MH018951); National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH","This study was funded in part by the University of Pittsburgh Central Research Development Fund through an award to Drs.

Theories suggest these disparities exist due to stressors specific to belonging to a minority group; however, few studies have specifically explored differences between SM and heterosexual individuals in clinical eating disorder samples. Thus, the present study compared SM and heterosexual patients with eating disorders on demographic characteristics and eating disorder and psychological outcomes during day hospital treatment. Method: Patients (N = 389) completed surveys of eating pathology, mood, anxiety, and skills use at treatment admission, 1-month post-admission, discharge, and 6-month follow-up. Overall, 19.8% of patients (n = 79) identified as SM, while 8.0% (n = 32) reported not identifying with any sexual orientation. SM were more likely to present across genders (17.7% of females, 24.2% of males, 33.3% of transgender patients, and 87.5% of nonbinary patients). Results: SM patients were significantly more likely to endorse major depressive disorder, panic disorder, and self-harm at admission than their heterosexual counterparts. Multilevel models demonstrated that across time, SM patients demonstrated greater eating pathology, emotion dysregulation, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. Significant interactions between sexual orientation and time were found for eating pathology and emotion dysregulation, such that although SM patients started treatment with higher scores, they improved at a faster rate compared to heterosexual patients. Discussion: Consistent with minority stress theory, SM patients report greater overall eating disorder and comorbid symptoms. Importantly, results do not support that there appear to be significant disparities in treatment outcome for SM patients in this sample of day hospital patients. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","day hospital; eating disorders; minority stress; sexual orientation; treatment outcome","Adult; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Hospitals; Humans; Male; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult; adult; anorexia nervosa; anxiety; Article; Beck Depression Inventory; controlled study; coping behavior; eating disorder; emotionality; epidemiological data; family therapy; feeding behavior; female; health care access; health disparity; heterosexuality; hospital admission; hospital discharge; human; major clinical study; male; mini international neuropsychiatric interview; mood; outcome assessment; priority journal; psychologic assessment; psychometry; sexual and gender minority; sexual orientation; skill; stigma; test retest reliability; young adult; eating disorder; hospital; psychology; questionnaire; sexual and gender minority; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Bankoff S.M., Richards L.K., Bartlett B., Wolf E.J., Mitchell K.S., Examining weight and eating behavior by sexual orientation in a sample of male veterans, Comprehensive Psychiatry, 68, pp. 134-139, (2016); Beck A.T., Steer R.A., Brown G.K., Manual for the Beck depression inventory-II, (1996); Bland J.M., Altman D.G., Regression towards the mean, British Medical Journal, 308, 6942, (1994); Brandsma L., Eating disorders across the life span, Journal of Women & Aging, 19, 1-2, pp. 155-172, (2007); Brown T.A., Cusack A., Anderson L.K., Trim J., Nakamura T., Trunko M.E., Kaye W.H., Efficacy of a partial hospital programme for adults with eating disorders, European Eating Disorders Review, 26, pp. 241-252, (2018); Brown T.A., Forney K.J., Pinner D., Keel P.K., A randomized controlled trial of the body project: More than muscles for men with body dissatisfaction, International Journal of Eating Disorders, 50, 8, pp. 873-883, (2017); Brown T.A., Keel P.K., A randomized controlled trial of a peer co-led dissonance-based eating disorder prevention program for gay men, Behaviour Research and Therapy, 74, pp. 1-10, (2015); Calzo J.P., Blashill A.J., Brown T.A., Argenal R.L., Eating disorders and disordered weight and shape control behaviors in sexual minority populations, Current Psychiatry Reports, 19, 8, (2017); Carlat D.J., Camargo C.A., Herzog D.B., Eating disorders in males: A report on 135 patients, The American Journal of Psychiatry, 154, 8, pp. 1127-1132, (1997); Chaudoir S.R., Wang K., Pachankis J.E., What reduces sexual minority stress?

Preliminary research has shown associations between vaping and eating disorder symptoms, however, there remain gaps in this knowledge among college students. The aim of this study was to determine the associations between vaping and a self-reported lifetime eating disorder diagnosis and eating disorder risk among a large sample of college students. Cross-sectional data from the 2018-2019 national (U.S.) Healthy Minds Study (n = 51,231) were analyzed. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the unadjusted and adjusted associations between vaping or e-cigarette use in the past 30 days and a self-reported lifetime eating disorder diagnosis (any diagnosis, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder) and eating disorder risk (SCOFF). Among the sample, 19.0% of participants reported vaping or e-cigarette use in the past 30 days, 3.7% self-reported any lifetime eating disorder diagnosis, and 25.0% were at elevated risk for an eating disorder. Vaping or e-cigarette use was associated with higher odds of all eating disorder measures, including the self-reported lifetime eating disorder diagnosis items (any diagnosis, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder) and elevated eating disorder risk, while adjusting for demographic and confounding variables. Among a large sample of college students, vaping or e-cigarette use was associated with a self-reported lifetime eating disorder diagnosis and elevated eating disorder risk, which may exacerbate the many medical complications associated with eating disorder behaviors. Clinical professionals should screen for eating disorder behaviors among college students who report vaping or e-cigarette use to monitor symptoms and medical complications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anorexia nervosa;

People who identify themselves as transgender people are more vulnerable and may have higher rates of dissatisfaction with their bodies which are often associated with a disorderly diet in an attempt to change the bodily characteristics of the genus of birth and, conversely, to accentuate the characteristics of the desired sexual identity. Aim: The purpose of this work is to examine the association between dissatisfaction with one’s own body and eating and weight disorders in people with gender dysphoria. Results: Gender dysphoria and eating disorders are characterized by a serious discomfort tothe body and the body suffers in both conditions. The results of our study suggest that rates of pathological eating behaviors and symptoms related to a disordered diet are high in patients with gender dysphoria and that standard screening for these symptoms must be considered in both populations at the time of evaluation and during the course of the treatment. Conclusion: In light of this evidence, clinicians should always investigate issues related to sexuality and gender identity in patients with eating disorders, to develop more effective prevention measures and better strategies for therapeutic intervention. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.","Anorexia nervosa; Body image; Bulimia nervosa; Eating disorders; Gender dysphoria; Gender identity","Body Image; Body Weight; Emotions; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Feeding Behavior; Female; Gender Dysphoria; Gender Identity; Humans; Male; anxiety; Article; body image; body weight; body weight disorder; dysphoria; eating disorder; gender dysphoria; gender identity; human; ICD-11; mental disease; mental health; mood disorder; screening; social problem; transgender; transsexualism; body image; eating disorder; emotion; feeding behavior; female; gender dysphoria; gender identity; male; metabolism; physiology; psychology","","","","","","","Cuzzolaro M., Milano W., Gender idendity, sexual orientation, body image, eating, and weight” chapter on, Body image, eating, and weight.

As members of a gender minority, transgender individuals face many challenges. Many experience distress, depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation related to gender nonconformity and transphobia. Stress and trauma may contribute to the development of fibromyalgia (FM) syndrome, characterised by widespread pain and fatigue. The prevalence of FM among transgenders is not known. Methods. Transgender participants were recruited at a specialised clinic. Questionnaires included the Widespread Pain Index (WPI), the Symptom Severity Score (SSS) and the SF-36. Data concerning hormonal treatment protocols was retrieved from charts. The current prevalence of FM was determined, as well as the prevalence before and after testosterone treatment among TM. Pearson correlations were calculated between all measures. Results. 115 participants were recruited, 62.6% transgender men (TM), 37.4% transgender women (TW). 17 individuals (14.8%) fulfilled the 2011 modified ACR FM criteria, for a rate of 19.4% among TM and 6.98% among TW. Among TM, FM was associated with younger age, smoking and SF-36 sub-scales related to physical functioning, role limitation due to physical pain, fatigue, pain and general health. Among TW, FM was associated with social status, employment, depression, existing medical treatment and substance abuse, as well as SF-36 subscales related to role limitations affected due to pain. Conclusion. Fibromyalgia symptoms are highly prevalent among Israeli transgender individuals and may be related to psychological distress and gender dysphoria. Healthcare professionals treating transgenders should remain vigilant for the occurrence of chronic pain, fatigue and other FM-related symptoms and be prepared to treat and/or refer such patients accordingly. © Copyright CliniCal and ExpErimEntal rhEumatology 2021.","Chronic pain;

Method: Parents of patients (10-18 yrs) referred to child and adolescent psychiatry participated in an anonymous online survey, approximately six weeks after the first easing of lockdown measures. Parents rated the amount, the content and the psychological impact of their children's media use before, during and after the lockdown. Results: N = 477 parents completed the survey. Patients showed a significant increase in media time during the lockdown (including devices such as mobile, tablet/PC, video game console, TV, and activities such as gaming, social media) and a moderate increase in the negative impact of media use on everyday life. After the lockdown, total media time returned to pre-COVID-19 levels in most patients, but remained slightly higher in males. A worsening of the main psychopathological problem during lockdown was related to elevated media time in children (10-13 yrs), but not in adolescents (14-18 yrs). Conclusion: According to parents' retrospective ratings, the increase in screen media time was reversible, and seems to reflect an expected coping strategy during lockdown. However, male patients did not completely return to pre-COVID-19 gaming time, and a small number continued to display excessive gaming. © 2021 The Authors","Child and adolescent psychiatry; COVID-19; Lockdown; Pandemic; Problematic use of the internet; Screen media use","Adolescent; Adolescent Psychiatry; Child; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Humans; Male; Parents; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2; Switzerland; adolescent health; adult; anxiety disorder; Article; attention deficit disorder; child; child health; child psychiatry; controlled study; coping behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; eating disorder; female; gender dysphoria; health survey; heart atrium septum defect; human; leisure; lockdown; major clinical study; male; mental disease; obsessive compulsive disorder; parent; problem behavior; psychological aspect; school child; screen time; sex difference; social media; television viewing; video game; young adult; adolescent; child parent relation; communicable disease control; retrospective study; Switzerland","","","","","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF","SW has received royalties from Thieme Hogrefe, Kohlhammer, Springer, Beltz in the last five years.

Simultaneously, individuals with eating disorders reported increasing symptomology (Termorshuizen et al. in Int J Eat Disord. 53(11):1780–90, 2020). This study compares Emergency Department utilization at a pediatric quaternary-level care center by patients with eating disorders during the pandemic (March–Dec 2020) vs March-Dec 2019. We hypothesize that there was an increase in presentation of patients with eating disorders. An Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside query of the electronic medical record system identified patients with eating disorder diagnoses per ICD9/ICD10 codes aged 6–23 who presented to the Emergency Department between March 1st and December 31st of 2020 and 2019. Subsequent retrospective chart review was carried out. Patients were excluded from analysis if the presenting problem was not directly related to the eating disorder. During March–Dec 2019, 0.581% percent of all patients presented to the Emergency Department due to an eating disorder. During the same time frame in 2020, however, that percentage increased to 1.265%. Statistical significance was corrected using a Benjamini–Hochberg analysis. Despite a 66.5% decline in overall visits to the Emergency Department, the percentage of patients presenting with eating disorders doubled during the pandemic. During the pandemic, the total time spent awaiting placement significantly increased, and the number of patients identifying as transgender and/or nonbinary increased. Our data support the hypothesis that eating disorder presentation increased during the pandemic. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2SLGBTQIA+; Boarding; Child and adolescent psychiatry; Eating disorders; Emergency department","Adolescent; Child; COVID-19; Emergency Service, Hospital; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Humans; Pandemics; Retrospective Studies; adolescent; adult; Article; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; eating disorder; electronic medical record system; emergency ward; female; human; length of stay; major clinical study; male; medical record review; pandemic; retrospective study; suicidal behavior; suicidal ideation; transgender; eating disorder; hospital emergency service","","","","","American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, AACAP, (Summer Medical Student Fellowship); American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, AACAP","","Hartnett K.P., Kite-Powell A., Devies J., .

Methods: Analyses include data from 5,488 U.S. high school students from the 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys in four jurisdictions (Broward County, FL; Chicago, IL; Los Angeles, CA; San Diego, CA). Participants were 56% Hispanic/Latino, 21% black/African American, and 14% white. Two items asked about perceived gender expression; responses were classified into three groups: highly gender conforming (e.g., very masculine boys), moderately gender conforming, gender nonconforming (e.g., feminine boys). Sex-stratified multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association between gender expression, peer victimization, and DWCBs in previous month (fasting, using diet pills/liquids/powders, and purging [vomiting or using laxatives]), controlling for potential confounders. Results: Overall, 12% of respondents reported fasting, 6% reported diet pill use, and 5% reported purging, with significantly higher prevalence among gender nonconforming than among gender conforming male students (p <.001). In adjusted models, gender nonconforming male students had greater odds of fasting (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 3.0 [2.0–4.7]), diet pill use (6.1 [3.7–9.9]), and purging (7.2 [3.6–14.8]), relative to moderately conforming males. No significant associations were found among female students. Adding peer victimization to models modestly attenuated the association between gender nonconformity and DWCBs for male students. Conclusions: In probability samples of U.S. high school students, we observed marked differences by gender expression in DWCBs among male students but not among female students. Gender expression-related stigma should be addressed within clinical and school-based interventions to prevent DWCBs. © 2020 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine","Bullying; Eating disorders; Gender expression; Gender nonconformity; Peer victimization; Weight control","Adolescent; Bullying; Chicago; Crime Victims; Female; Florida; Humans; Los Angeles; Male; Schools; Students; laxative; adolescent; African American; Article; body weight control; bullying; controlled study; diet supplementation; disease association; disordered weight control behavior; eating disorder; fasting; female; femininity; gender identity; high school student; Hispanic; human; major clinical study; male; masculinity; outcome assessment; peer group; peer victimization; pill; powder; prevalence; priority journal; purging disorder; risk behavior; self report; sexual orientation; transgender; victim; vomiting; bullying; California; crime victim; epidemiology; Florida; Illinois; school; student","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, (T71-MC00009, T76-MC00001); U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS; National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA, (F32DA042506); National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK, (1R01DK120713); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK; Health Resources and Services Administration, HRSA; Maternal and Child Health Bureau, MCHB","S.B.

Method: Eighty-six TG youth with a mean age of 17 (sd = 3.2) agreed to participate in the study. The majority of our sample identified as TG male (n = 60) with 20 participants identifying as TG female and 6 identifying as non-binary. The racial ethnic breakdown of our sample was 8.2% Black, 8.2% Multi-racial, 1.2% Native American, and 82.4% White. Over ¼ of our sample endorsed at least one episode of objective binge eating in the last 28 days and 62% endorsed a history of NSSI. Results: Negative urgency was significantly associated with the odds of NSSI, objective binge eating, and general eating disorder symptoms. Lack of premeditation was significantly related to the odds of NSSI only. No other factors were significantly associated with NSSI or symptoms of BN. Conclusions: Negative urgency appears to be an important personality construct in understanding increased risk for NSSI and BN symptoms in transgender youth. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bulimia nervosa (BN); Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI); Transgender youth; UPPS","Adolescent; Bulimia; Bulimia Nervosa; Female; Humans; Impulsive Behavior; Male; Self-Injurious Behavior; Transgender Persons; adolescent; adult; American Indian; Article; automutilation; binge eating disorder; bulimia; Caucasian; demography; disease association; emotionality; ethnicity; female; human; impulsiveness; major clinical study; male; medical history; multiracial person; priority journal; suicidal behavior; transgender; impulsiveness","","","","","Academic Research Council","The authors gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Alexis Teeters, BA and Katrina Lewis, BA.

Examining ED pathology both across binary and minority-gender groups, and relative to racial/ethnic identification is necessary to inform screening and culturally-sensitive intervention efforts. This study investigated patterns of ED symptomology among youth and adults (N = 13658) who telephoned treatment centers in the United States when seeking clinical support for ED symptoms. Analyses examined data from participants who completed a semi-structured clinical interview. Results indicated that Anorexia nervosa was the most common diagnosis in each gender category and for a majority of race/ethnic groups; Black individuals had elevated rates of binge eating disorder. Compared to females, males were less likely to endorse all ED symptoms (ps <.001); gender minority status was also associated with decreased report of a majority of ED symptoms. Asian and Black individuals were less likely than Whites to endorse most ED symptoms. When compared to Whites, Hispanic/Latinx and Bi/Multi-racial participants did not demonstrate significant differences in presentation across a majority of ED symptoms. Overall findings suggest individuals with female gender and White race may seek treatment from an ED treatment facility with greater frequency than other demographic groups. Noted exceptions include Hispanic/Latinx and Bi/Multi-racial individuals, for whom ED pathology may be represented comparably to Whites. While findings confirm traditional patterns in gender and racial/ethnic representation in EDs, current study findings also underscore that EDs are not culture bound. © 2020 Association Française de Therapie Comportementale et Cognitive","Eating disorder; Ethnicity; Gender identity; Race; Transgender","","","","","","National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (T32-MH018261)","This research received no specific grant from any funding agency, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.

Yet, there is no research that provides guidance to clinicians providing care for youth with the unique triad of gender dysphoria, ASD, and disordered eating. This case series discusses trends in presentation and management of three cases from a multidisciplinary gender care clinic. All three individuals endorsed rigid thoughts around food and/or body appearance, which affected nutritional intake; however, their presenting eating disorder behaviors, described etiology for disordered thoughts, diagnosis, and level of engagement in a multidisciplinary treatment model varied. Based on these cases we hypothesize several strategies including early engagement with ASD specialists, proactive screening and discussions around eating with all transgender youth with suspected/confirmed ASD, continued discussions throughout care, as disordered eating behaviors may change after the initiation of gender-affirming medications, dietician visits early in treatment regardless of endorsed thoughts and behaviors, tailored management to the unique needs of each individual and their eating thoughts/behaviors, and consistent multidisciplinary collaboration. © 2021 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine","Autism spectrum disorder; Disordered eating; Transgender; Youth","Adolescent; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Gender Dysphoria; Gender Identity; Humans; Transgender Persons; estrogen; fluoxetine; olanzapine; testosterone; adolescent; Article; autism; automutilation; body mass; body weight gain; body weight loss; caloric restriction; case report; clinical article; clinical feature; cognitive behavioral therapy; depression; dialectical behavior therapy; dietary intake; eating disorder; female; follow up; food fussiness; food intake; food preference; guilt; human; increased appetite; independent living; male; malnutrition; medical record review; mental health; motivation; obsessive compulsive disorder; patient referral; priority journal; psychoeducation; self care; suicidal ideation; transgender; autism; eating disorder; gender dysphoria; gender identity","","fluoxetine, 54910-89-3, 56296-78-7, 59333-67-4; olanzapine, 132539-06-1; testosterone, 58-22-0","","","","","Jones B.A., Haycraft E., Murjan S., Arcelus J., Body dissatisfaction and disordered eating in trans people: A systematic review of the literature, Int Rev Psychiatry, 28, pp. 81-94, (2015); Diemer E.W., Grant J.D., Munn-Chernoff M.A., Et al., Gender identity, sexual orientation, and eating-related pathology in a national sample of college students, J Adolesc Health, 57, pp. 144-149, (2015); McClain Z., Peebles R., Body image and eating disorders among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth, Pediatr Clin North America, 63, pp. 1079-1090, (2016); Watson R.J., Veale J.F., Saewyc E.M., Disordered eating behaviors among transgender youth: Probability profiles from risk and protective factors, Int J Eat Disord, 50, pp. 515-522, (2017); Guss C.E., Williams D.N., Reisner S.L., Et al., Disordered weight management behaviors, nonprescription steroid use, and weight perception in transgender youth, J Adolesc Health, 60, pp. 17-22, (2016); Donaldson A.A., Hall A., Neukirch J., Et al., Multidisciplinary care considerations for gender nonconforming adolescents with eating disorders: A case series, Int J Eat Disord, 51, pp. 475-479, (2018); Coelho J.S., Suen J., Clark B.A., Et al., Eating disorder diagnoses and symptom presentation in transgender youth: A scoping review, Curr Psychiatry Rep, 21, pp. 1-10, (2019); Huke V., Turk J., Saeidi S., Et al., Autism spectrum disorders in eating disorder populations: A systematic review, Eur Eat Disord Rev, 21, pp. 345-351, (2013); Westwood H., Tchanturia K., Autism spectrum disorder in anorexia nervosa: An updated literature review, Curr Psychiatry Rep, 19, (2017); Lucarelli J., Pappas D., Welchons L., Augustyn M., Autism spectrum disorder and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, J Dev Behav Pediatr, 38, pp. 79-80, (2017); de Vries A.L.C., Noens I.L.J., Cohen-Kettenis P.T., Et al., Autism spectrum disorders in gender dysphoric children and adolescents, J Autism Dev Disord, 40, pp. 930-936, (2010); van der Miesen A.I.R., Hurley H., Bal A.M., de Vries A.L.C., Prevalence of the wish to be of the opposite gender in adolescents and adults with autism spectrum disorder, Arch Sex Behav, 47, pp. 2307-2317, (2018); Hisle-Gorman E., Landis C.A., Susi A., Et al., Gender dysphoria in children with autism spectrum disorder, LGBT health, 6, pp. 95-100, (2019); Warrier V., Greenberg D.M., Weir E., Et al., Elevated rates of autism, other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diagnoses, and autistic traits in transgender and gender-diverse individuals, Nat Commun, 11, pp. 1-12, (2020); Strang J.F., Meagher H., Kenworthy L., Et al., Initial clinical guidelines for co-occurring autism spectrum disorder and gender dysphoria or incongruence in adolescents, J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol, 47, pp. 105-115, (2016); Eist H.I., DBT skills Training Manual, 2nd Ed.

However, research on connections between ED and gender identity are limited. Researchers who produce explanatory models, content themselves with faulting the sociocultural ideal of slimness for women, but they fail to grasp the connection between culture, gender and the body and they fall short of integrating this perspective into existing psychological knowledge about ED. Psychological research informed by feminist theory has begun to bridge this gap, but this growing area of research needs to be further developed and should include an understanding of ED in persons with all gender identities. This article expands the discussion of gender and ED, by grounding ED in an understanding of gender itself and by discussing methodological implications of this understanding. © Copyright © 2020 Springmann, Svaldi and Kiegelmann.","eating disorders; etiology; feminist theory; gender; interdisciplinary research; LGBTIQ; methodology","","","","","","Karlsruhe University of Education; Ministry of Science, Research and Culture; OpenAccess Publishing Fund of the University of T?bingen; Hans Böckler Stiftung","Funding text 1: Research for this paper was supported by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung in Germany with a dissertation scholarship for Marie-Luise Springmann.

Thus, the present study utilized an intersectional framework to examine how three different forms of racism (i.e. sexual racism, gendered racism, and internalized racism) are associated with disordered eating among sexual minority Asian American men, as well as the mediating role of emotional eating. A cross-sectional survey containing the study’s measures of interest were administered to participants. The final sample consisted of 180 sexual minority Asian American men. Both sexual racism and internalized racism were positively associated with disordered eating whereas gendered racism was not associated with disordered eating Emotional eating mediated the association between internalized racism and disordered eating, though it did not mediate the association between sexual racism and disordered eating. Researchers and practitioners are encouraged to utilize an intersectional framework that takes into account multiple forms of racism, especially sexual racism and internalized racism, when considering this underrepresented population’s disordered eating. Results also demonstrate the importance of addressing racism in eating disorder prevention efforts among sexual minority Asian American men. © 2023 Taylor & Francis.","","Asian; Cross-Sectional Studies; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Humans; Male; Racism; Sexual and Gender Minorities; adult; Article; Asian American; bisexual male; bulimia; cross-sectional study; Eating Attitudes Test; eating disorder; emotional eating; female; gendered racism; homosexual male; human; internalized racism; LGBTQIA+ people; Likert scale; male; mental health; psychological distress assessment; questionnaire; sexual and gender minority; sexual racism; social network; social problem; Three-Factor-Eating-Questionnaire; transgender and gender nonbinary; Asian; psychology; racism","","","","","Asian American Psychological Association, AAPA","The work was supported by the Asian American Psychological Association [Stephen C.

A substantial proportion of adolescent AN patients shows impaired personality functioning, which might be a relevant but understudied aspect of illness severity. The developmental status of identity as key element of personality is suggested to influence inpatient treatment outcome in adolescents with AN. Methods: This study analyzed existing data of N = 60 adolescents with AN. Multilevel models assessed the influence of identity functioning, measured by the Assessment of Identity Development in Adolescence (AIDA) at admission, on weight gain [BMI (body mass index), BMI-SDS (BMI standard deviation score)] during 10 weeks of inpatient treatment. Moreover, the influence of other indicators of illness severity, i.e., eating disorders and comorbid psychopathologies, was explored. Results: As expected, higher AIDA scores negatively influenced the course of weight gain. A similar effect was observed for other psychopathology measures, especially body image distortion. In general, higher weight at admission was associated with less weight gain. Higher weight at admission was also predicted by higher other psychopathology measures, but not AIDA scores. Conclusion: The course of weight gain during inpatient treatment was hampered in adolescent AN patients who have difficulties developing a stable identity. Unlike other aspects of psychopathology, this was independent of the initial weight. Thus, in addition to the level of underweight and other aspects of psychopathology, difficulties in identity development constitute a relevant aspect of illness severity in AN. This recommends consideration of identity development during treatment.

However, very little research has examined the prevalence and correlates of cybervictimization among diverse subpopulations of youth. Data and methods Data from 13,602 adolescents aged 12 to 17 were drawn from the 2019 Canadian Health Survey on Children and Youth. Adolescents reported on their experiences of cybervictimization in the past 12 months, general mental health, and eating disorder symptoms; adolescents aged 15 to 17 reported on suicidal ideation and attempt; and parents reported on problems with depression and anxiety. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of experiencing cybervictimization according to characteristics, including gender identity, population group, same-gender attraction, low family income, and the presence of chronic conditions and digital media habits. Logistic regression models were also used to estimate the odds of experiencing each mental health difficulty by sociodemographic characteristics and experience of cybervictimization. Results The odds of experiencing cybervictimization were higher among transgender and non-binary youth, females attracted to the same gender or unsure of their attraction, and adolescents living with chronic conditions (particularly females and those living in low-income households). Cybervictimization was consistently associated with a greater risk of poor general mental health, depression or anxiety, eating disorder symptoms, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt. These associations did not differ according to the sociodemographic characteristics assessed. In terms of digital media habits, lower frequencies of use were generally associated with a lower likelihood of experiencing cybervictimization. Interpretation While certain population groups appear to be at a higher risk of experiencing cybervictimization, the experience of cybervictimization is associated with similar mental health indicators for all adolescents. © His Majesty the King in Right of Canada as represented by the Minister of Industry, 2023","adolescence;

Additionally, we evaluated the demographic factors and comorbidities that are predictive of gender dysphoria in patients with suicidal behaviors. Methods: We included 319,430 patients (aged 6-24 years) with suicidal behaviors and a primary psychiatric diagnosis (per ICD-10 criteria) of mood disorders (depressive disorders, 75.3%; bipolar disorders, 15.9%; and other mood disorders, 8.8%) from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2018-2019). We compared the distributions of categorical variables using the Pearson ?2 test and continuous variables using an independentsamples t test in inpatients without versus with gender dysphoria. We used a logistic regression model to calculate the odds ratio (OR) to assess the demographic and comorbid characteristics of gender dysphoria with suicidal behaviors. Results: The prevalence of codiagnosis of gender dysphoria in inpatients hospitalized for suicidal behaviors was 1.5%. Gender dysphoria was seen in a higher proportion of adolescents (68.2%), females (73.6%), those from high-income families (51.7%), and those from metropolitan counties (88.8%). The prevalent psychiatric comorbidities in inpatients with gender dysphoria included anxiety disorders (63.6%), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; 28.2%), and neurodevelopmental disorders (27.4%). Comorbidities including somatic disorders (OR = 2.30), eating disorders (OR = 1.95), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OR = 1.71), anxiety disorders (OR = 1.59), PTSD (OR = 1.32), and neurodevelopmental disorders (OR = 1.17) increased the likelihood of codiagnoses of gender dysphoria. Conclusions: There exists a high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities in those with gender dysphoria and hospitalized for suicidal behavior. Our findings call for prompt evaluations of comorbidities of suicidal behaviors among adolescents and youth with gender dysphoria to provide a coordinated approach to suicide prevention, thereby reducing the future risk of poor health outcomes and mortality. © 2023, Physicians Postgraduate Press Inc..

These early traumas may interfere with the process of integrating the mind and body. Symptoms of gender dysphoria often arise from, or increase in response to, subsequent separations later in life, as individuals transition from childhood to adulthood. Increased referrals to gender clinics are noted at puberty or the point of separation from the family, as individuals face the prospect of leaving home to go to university. Affected by anxieties associated with the onset of puberty or separation anxieties, these individuals sometimes seek a medical transition to gain control over their bodies. Exploring underlying psychoanalytic issues can help clinicians assess various conscious and unconscious influences, and help patients make more informed decisions on whether to pursue a medical transition. A focus on defence mechanisms and forms of thinking can help clinicians find ways of working with individuals who may be highly defensive and concrete in their thinking and feel threatened by the functioning of their minds. © 2023 Association of Child Psychotherapists.","adolescence; gender dysphoria; identity; psychic retreat; Sexuality; trans identity; trauma","testosterone; adult; anorexia; anxiety; Article; behavior; case report; clinical article; clinical practice; comorbidity; defense mechanism; depression; dysphoria; eating disorder; ego development; emotional stress; emotionality; female; femininity; gender dysphoria; human; injury; interpersonal communication; masculinity; mental health service; orgasm; patient assessment; personality disorder; psychoanalysis; psychotherapist; psychotherapy; qualitative research; religion; risk factor; scientific literature; separation anxiety; sexual abuse; sexuality; social work; transgender; treatment outcome; young adult","","testosterone, 58-22-0","","","Susan Evans","I would like to thank Susan Evans, John Cohn, Dr Dave Somekh, Dr Roberto D’Angelo, Ian Williamson, Heinz Weiss, Shlomit Gorin, Ema Zane and Bob Hinshelwood for their help in writing this paper.","Bell D., First do no harm, International Journal of Psychoanalysis, 101, 5, pp. 1031-1038, (2020); Bion W.R., Attacks on linking, The International Journal of Psychoanalysis, 40, pp. 308-315, (1959); Bonfatto M., Crasnow E., Gender/Ed identities: An overview of our current work as child psychotherapists in the gender identity development service, Journal of Child Psychotherapy, 44, 1, pp. 29-46, (2018); Britton R., Emancipation from the superego, Sex, death, and the superego: Experiences and developments in neuroscience, pp. 103-116, (2021); Cass H., Review of gender identity services for children and young people, British Medical Journal, (2022); Churcher C.A., Spiliadis A., ‘Taking the lid off the box’: The value of extended clinical assessment for adolescents presenting with gender identity difficulties, Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 24, 2, pp. 338-352, (2019); De Graaf N.M., Giovanardi G., Zitz C., Carmichael P., Sex ratio in children and adolescents referred to the gender identity development service in the UK (2009–2016), Archives of Sexual Behavior, 47, 5, pp. 1301-1304, (2018); Evans M., Freedom to think: The need for thorough assessment and treatment of gender dysphoric children, British Journal Psychiatry Bulletin, 45, 5, pp. 285-290, (2021); Evans M., ‘If only I were a boy …’: Psychotherapeutic explorations of transgender in children and adolescents, British Journal of Psychotherapy, 38, 2, pp. 269-285, (2022); Evans S., Evans M., Gender dysphoria: A therapeutic model for working with children, adolescents, and young adults, (2021); Kaltiala-Heino R., Sumia M., Tyolajarvi M., Lindberg N., Two years of gender identity service for minors: Overrepresentation of natal girls with severe problems in adolescent development, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health, 9, 1, (2015); Kozlowska K., McClure G., Chudleigh C., Maguire A.M., Gessler D., Scher S., Ambler G.R., Australian children and adolescents with gender dysphoria: Clinical presentations and challenges experienced by a multidisciplinary team and gender service, Human Systems, 1, 1, pp. 70-95, (2021); Levine S.B., Abbruzzese E., Mason J.W., Reconsidering informed consent for trans-identified children, adolescents, and young adults, Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy, 48, 7, pp. 706-727, (2022); Quinodoz D., Termination of a fe/male transsexual patient’s analysis: An example of general validity, International Journal of Psychoanalysis, 83, 4, pp. 783-798, (2002); Care of children and adolescents with gender dysphoria, Summary, (2022); Williams G., Reflections on some dynamics of eating disorders: ‘No entry’ defences and foreign bodies, The International Journal of Psycho-Analysis, 78, 5, pp. 927-941, (1997)","M.
